# 📂 Project Structure

This project uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org), with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [Typst](https://typst.app/) to generate PDFs conforming to a common style guide. Content, citations, formatting logic, and outputs are kept distinct. This ensures consistent typesetting, allows content and styling (including citation formatting) to be changed independently, and enables automated generation of consistent and fully-formatted reports.

## 📄 Report PDFs

* **Report PDFs:** You can find the latest report PDFs under [Releases](https://github.com/the-solipsist/lirneasia-d4dasia/releases).

## 📁 Directory Layout

* **`_quarto.yml`**: Project-level configuration.

* **`bibliography/`**:

  * `d4dasia-bib.json`: Master bibliography (CSL JSON format, generated using BetterBibTex and Zotero).
  * `*.csl`: Citation Style Language files, used to format citations in the appropriate style (such as the CMoS 18th edition).

* **`report_pdfs/`**: The local output directory.  
  **Note:** This folder is ignored by git (`.gitignore`). It is populated only when you run `quarto render` locally.

* **`_scripts/`**: Helper scripts for the build process (`link-pdfs.ts`).

* **`_extensions/lirneasia/`**:

  This directory contains files needed to generate any LIRNEasia report.

  * `_extension.yml`: YAML file that provides Quarto with information about the 'lirneasia' extension.
  * `_brand.yml`:  LIRNEasia house style, including colours and typography.
  * `assets/logos/`: LIRNEasia logos for background watermark and for the title page.
  * Typst template partials for use with Quarto (e.g., `typst-template.typ`, `typst-show.typ`, `page.typ`, etc.)

* **`reports/`**: Source files for individual country reports, the synthesis report, and shared content.

  * Country reports in:  
    `id/` (Indonesia), `in/` (India), `lk/` (Sri Lanka), `np/` (Nepal), `ph/` (Philippines), `pk/` (Pakistan), `th/` (Thailand), `kr/` (South Korea).
  * Synthesis report: `synthesis/`
  * Content common to multiple reports: `common/`

## 📑 Country Directory Format

Each country folder (e.g., `reports/lk/`) follows this standard structure:

* **Report Source:** `d4dasia_country-report_{xx}.qmd` (where `{xx}` is the ISO country code).
* **Metadata:** `_metadata.yml` (Country-specific settings).
* **Assets:** `images/` folder containing diagrams and photos (if used).
* **Local Bibliography:** `d4dasia-bib-{xx}.json` (Optional, for citations not included in the master bibliography file).

# ✏️ Editing and Contributing

## 📝 Prerequisites & Setup

To replicate this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) (and, optionally [Jujutsu](https://www.jj-vcs.dev/latest/), if you prefer to use `jj` as the front-end for Git).
* [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).  
  Note: Quarto bundles [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) and [`typst`](https://typst.app/), so there's no need to install them separately unless you're debugging.
 
To edit the Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files locally, it is recommended to use a suitable text editor, which can handle bibliography files, etc., like:

* [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
  The [Quarto Extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode/index.html) is highly recommended if using VS Code.
* [**Zettlr**](https://zettlr.com).  A very capable markdown editor, which some may prefer over VS Code.

To handle the bibliography, it is advisable to use:

* [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/).  A free, easy-to-use tool to help collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.
* [**BetterBibTex**](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).  
  This is an add-on for Zotero.  
  Please ensure that the citation key pattern used with BetterBibTex is `auth.lower + shorttitle(2,2) + year`!
  (Note: default is `auth.lower + shorttitle(3,3) + year`.)
* [**D4DAsia Zotero Group Library**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4962152/d4dasia).  
  You'll need to have a Zotero Web account, and be added to the D4DAsia group library to enable two-way syncing of items with the library.
  While the group library is public, it is read-only unless you're a group member.

## 🧾 Cloning & Rendering

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

~~~bash
git clone git@github.com:the-solipsist/lirneasia-d4dasia.git d4dasia
cd d4dasia
~~~

### 2️⃣ Render the Reports

To generate the PDFs locally:

**Render the entire project:**

~~~bash
quarto render
~~~

**Render a specific country report (e.g., Sri Lanka):**

~~~bash
quarto render reports/lk/d4dasia_country-report_lk.qmd
~~~

Output PDFs are saved next to each `.qmd`.\
After rendering, they are automatically **hard-linked** into `report_pdfs/` by a post-render script (`_scripts/link-pdfs.ts`).

### 3️⃣ Review, Commit, and Push Your Changes

After cloning the repository, all work happens directly on your local copy of the **main** branch. The general workflow is:

1. Make your changes  
2. Commit them in logical units  
3. Repeat as needed  
4. Optionally render the project  
5. Push to GitHub  

#### 1️⃣ Make your changes

Edit the relevant `.qmd` files. Save your work locally in your text editor.

#### 2️⃣ Commit your changes in logical units

A *commit* should represent one coherent set of changes. You may make several commits before pushing.

To commit **all modified files at once**, use:

~~~bash
git commit -a -m "lk: revise introduction and update figure 3"
~~~

This is the simplest workflow, and usually what you.

##### 🔹 Optional: committing only specific files

If you want to commit only some of your edits (not all modified files), you may stage just those files:

~~~bash
git add reports/lk/d4dasia_country-report_lk.qmd
git commit -m "lk: improve introduction section"
~~~

Repeat the edit → commit cycle as many times as needed before you're ready to push the changes to Github.

#### 3️⃣ (Optional) Render your changes locally

You may verify that the document renders correctly before pushing:

~~~bash
quarto render
~~~

Or render just the report you edited:

~~~bash
quarto render reports/lk/d4dasia_country-report_lk.qmd
~~~

This helps catch formatting or citation issues early.

#### 4️⃣ Push your changes to GitHub

When your commits are ready:

~~~bash
git push origin main
~~~

GitHub will automatically regenerate the PDFs using the workflow described in  **[How PDFs are auto-generated by GitHub](#-how-pdfs-are-auto-generated-by-github)**.

If you are **not a collaborator**, you must fork the repository and submit your edits through a **pull request** instead of pushing.

# 🏗️ What does this code do? How does Quarto work?

Quarto is the tool that ties everything in this repository together. When you run `quarto render`, Quarto performs a multi-step processing pipeline:

### 1. Quarto reads:

* the project configuration (`_quarto.yml`)
* the `.qmd` source files
* report-level metadata (`_metadata.yml`)
* the master bibliography (`bibliography/d4dasia-bib.json`)
* any country-specific bibliography (`reports/<cc>/d4dasia-bib-<cc>.json`)
* the citation style file (`bibliography/*.csl`) specified in the project configuration

### 2. Quarto uses Pandoc to process Markdown

Pandoc converts the `.qmd` files into an intermediate document format (`.typ`) while, e.g., applying:

* block and inline formatting
* cross-referencing
* citation placeholders
* figure/table numbering

### 3. Pandoc invokes Citeproc

Citeproc resolves all citations using:

* the master bibliography
* optional country bibliographies
* the selected CSL citation style

This step generates fully formatted footnotes / inline citations, and bibliography entries.

### 4. Pandoc calls Typst for final PDF typesetting

Typst uses:

* typography rules defined in `_extensions/lirneasia/_brand.yml`
* layout and page structure from `typst-template.typ`, `page.typ`, and related files
* watermarks and logos from `_extensions/lirneasia/assets/`

Typst then produces the final professional-quality PDF.

### 5. Quarto runs the post-render script

After each PDF is produced, `_scripts/link-pdfs.ts`:
ZIP
* hard-links the PDF into `report_pdfs/`
* ensures consistent file naming and easier local navigation

This pipeline ensures that local builds and GitHub builds always produce identical output.

# 🤖 How PDFs are auto-generated by GitHub

GitHub Actions automatically builds the PDFs whenever relevant files change.

### How it works

A workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/publish-reports.yml`, which gets auto-triggered whenever content-related files are modified and committed to this repository.

### What the GitHub workflow does

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs Quarto in an Ubuntu instance.
3. Renders all PDFs using the same pipeline used locally.
4. If the branch is a **test branch (`test*`)**:\
   It uploads the generated PDFs as **Artifacts** (a downloadable ZIP).  This is only for testing purposes.
5. If the branch is **main**:\
   It creates a **tagged Release** and attaches the PDFs.

This way the PDFs are always kept up-to-date.

Note: Collaborators normally push directly to main. The test* branch behavior is primarily for the project maintainers.
