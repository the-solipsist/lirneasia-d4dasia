# Executive summary

Thailand's data governance landscape is undergoing a significant
transformation, shaped by the country's ambition to modernize its
administrative systems, promote digital development, and respond to
rising concerns about privacy, security, and transparency. This report,
developed under the D4DAsia initiative, examines how Thailand's evolving
legal frameworks, institutions, and practices structure access to and
use of data, and how these dynamics influence democratic development and
civic participation.

Historically, Thailand adopted Continental European legal traditions
during the 19th century as part of its broader efforts to avoid
colonization and modernize its state machinery. Today, its data
governance framework is anchored in the 2017 Constitution, which affirms
the right to information and the protection of personal data. Over the
past two decades, the country has enacted several key laws, including
the Official Information Act (OIA, 1997), the Personal Data Protection
Act (PDPA, 2019), and the Digitalisation of Public Administration and
Services Delivery Act (DPASDA, 2019). Each of these laws represents a
specific layer in the country's approach to regulating data access,
transparency, and privacy.

However, despite these legislative advances, Thailand's data governance
regime remains fragmented and uneven in implementation. A key challenge
lies in the inconsistent application and interpretation of overlapping
legal frameworks. For instance, while the OIA mandates the disclosure of
public sector data, many government agencies exercise broad discretion
to withhold information on grounds of national security, institutional
convenience, or unclear data classification schemes. Similarly, the PDPA
establishes individual rights to data protection and privacy but has
suffered delays in full enforcement and is often misunderstood by public
and private actors alike. These legal frictions result in a landscape
where the same dataset might be simultaneously subject to open data
policies and data protection restrictions, depending on the agency or
context involved.

Thailand has made substantial efforts to promote data openness,
primarily through the work of the Digital Government Development Agency
(DGA), which manages the Government Data Catalog and the Open Data
Portal. These platforms aim to consolidate and release public sector
datasets to improve service delivery, increase transparency, and foster
innovation. The DGA also sets key performance indicators (KPIs) for
agencies and offers training programs to support open data practices.
Despite these efforts, most datasets (around 90%) remain accessible only
through reactive disclosure mechanisms, such as citizen requests, rather
than proactive publication.

Tensions between openness, privacy, and security are further complicated
by Thailand's political and administrative culture. Security laws such
as the Computer-Related Crime Act and the Cybersecurity Act, along with
broad definitions of disinformation and national interest, often create
a chilling effect on data sharing and public discourse. Moreover,
institutions responsible for regulating or managing data -- such as DGA,
the Digital Government Development Committee (DGDC), and the Personal
Data Protection Committee (PDPC) -- face limitations in authority,
coordination, and capacity.

Sector-specific case studies illustrate the practical difficulties and
opportunities for advancing data governance. In the health sector, the
National Health Security Office (NHSO) has demonstrated a proactive
attitude toward data sharing and citizen participation, particularly in
managing the Universal Coverage Scheme. Yet legal uncertainty about what
data can be shared and under which conditions continue to inhibit
transparency. In contrast, the financial sector has benefited from more
coherent regulatory guidance, with the Bank of Thailand emerging as a
leader in data governance implementation, particularly in the adoption
of open banking standards. Nonetheless, even in this relatively advanced
sector, inconsistent interpretation of the PDPA poses operational
challenges.

Ultimately, Thailand's data governance system reflects a broader tension
between aspiration and implementation. While the state recognizes the
value of data for development, innovation, and democratic participation,
it often defaults to risk aversion, legal ambiguity, and bureaucratic
discretion. Capacity constraints---particularly among local-level
officials and small- and medium-sized enterprises---further hinder
effective compliance and innovation. Moreover, public awareness of data
rights and participation in governance processes remain limited.

To move forward, Thailand must prioritize legal harmonization,
institutional coordination, and capacity building. Clearer guidance on
the relationship between openness and privacy, better training for both
public officials and private actors, and more inclusive mechanisms for
stakeholder engagement will be essential. Comparative lessons from
countries like South Korea, Australia, and the UK offer valuable models,
but successful reform will ultimately require local adaptation and
political will. Data governance in Thailand is at a crossroads: whether
it becomes a tool for democratization or control depends on the choices
made in the coming years.

# Introduction

This report is part of the "Harnessing Data for Democratic Development
in South and Southeast Asia" (D4DAsia) initiative. The project seeks to
critically examine how data governance is evolving across the region,
with attention to both formal frameworks and informal norms. In the case
of Thailand, this means analyzing how state, corporate, and civil
society actors shape the production, access, and use of data in ways
that either enable or constrain democratic values.

Thailand stands at a pivotal moment in its digital transformation
journey, where the governance of data is increasingly central to
questions of rights, development, and democratic accountability. As data
becomes ever more embedded in public services, commerce, and civic life,
the structures that govern its use -- i.e., laws, policies, practices,
and technologies -- have profound implications for inclusive and
equitable development.

Data governance is not only about protecting personal information or
ensuring cybersecurity. It also involves addressing power imbalances,
enabling innovation, and building systems that reflect public interest
priorities. When effectively governed, data can support goals such as
poverty reduction, climate resilience, and responsive public policy.
When neglected or misused, it risks reinforcing inequalities and eroding
public trust.

This report contributes to a broader comparative effort, joining case
studies from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri
Lanka, and South Korea. Each country offers distinct lessons. Thailand's
experience, in particular, highlights the tensions between digital
modernization and enduring governance challenges, and offers valuable
insights into how data governance can better align with democratic
aspirations. The research questions that this report attempts to explore
and answer are as follows:

1.  What is common, and what is nationally specific, in the emerging
    data governance architectures in South and Southeast Asia? What are
    the explanations?

2.  What are the implications of the emergent nature of the governance
    architecture? Because there is no overall design that envisions how
    the parts fit together, it is likely that there will be friction
    points and even contradictions. How are these being worked out?

3.  The emerging governance architecture involves trade-offs among
    objectives such as greater accountability of powerholders, economic
    growth, including creation of employment and wealth, resilience of
    systems, etc. How have different societies: (a) explicitly
    recognized the trade-offs or not; and (b) handled them?

4.  Are there legislative or policy innovations with potential for
    replication? What are the modalities of sharing experiences? Are
    developing countries learning from each other, or are they learning
    from developed countries?

5.  How were the laws and bills developed? What expertise was brought to
    bear? How open were the procedures? How receptive were drafters to
    suggestions and criticisms?

6.  How were capacity challenges addressed: by simplifying the laws or
    by tolerating incomplete implementation?

## Structure of the report

### Legal background and landscape

Though never colonized, Thailand adopted Continental European legal
traditions in the 19^th^ century, becoming a civil law country. The 2017
Constitution, its supreme law, outlines state structure and key rights
relevant to data governance -- i.e., freedom of expression, access to
information, and privacy. Data governance has shifted from secrecy laws
to national information and communications technology (ICT) strategies
like "IT 2000." While the public sector is governed by laws such as the
Personal Data Protection Act (2019) and Digitalisation of Public
Administration and Services Delivery Act (2019), the private sector
faces fragmented regulation.

### Increasing openness/access

This section focuses on constitutional guarantees of the rights to be
informed by, and to access, public data or information held by the
public sector. However, there is no legal requirement for the private
sector regarding openness and access to data.

#### Open standards and software

This section focuses on how Thai government agencies -- such as the
Digital Government Development Agency and Digital Government Development
Committee -- ensure consistency in data format, quality, and
interoperability. Despite this, the use and promotion of open-source
software remain underdeveloped and underfunded.

### Decreasing openness/access

This section examines legal frameworks that restrict data access, often
citing national security, as seen in the Computer-Related Crime Act and
Official Secrets Rules. Further limitations arise from disinformation
laws, data localization, and retention requirements. It also reviews the
Personal Data Protection Act (2019), which aligns with constitutional
privacy rights but faces implementation challenges due to ambiguous
guidelines and limited enforcement capacity in both the public and
private sectors.

#### Intellectual property law and data

This section explores the legal issues concerning data and copyright
laws, including a discussion on AI.

### Policy frictions and trade-offs

This section highlights how constitutional and statutory obligations to
disclose information are frequently undermined by privacy and security
concerns. These frictions lead to inconsistent implementation, reduced
trust in public institutions, and an overall lack of legal coherence.

### Good practices and potential learnings

Thailand has drawn on models from the United Kingdom, South Korea, and
Australia to inform its data governance frameworks. While training
programs and capacity-building efforts exist domestically, knowledge
exchange across sectors and public involvement remain limited.

### Policy development and capacity challenges

This final section assesses institutional and operational challenges
facing data governance in Thailand. Barriers include insufficient
resources, vague mandates, weak leadership support, and low digital
literacy. These challenges are prevalent in both the public and private
sectors, making meaningful implementation of governance frameworks
difficult to sustain.

### Sectoral deep dives

This section delves into the application of data governance across key
sectors. In the public health sector, the National Health Security
Office attempts to balance openness and privacy but faces limited
capacity and unclear policy direction. In the financial sector, the Bank
of Thailand has promoted open banking and digital statement sharing,
although overlapping laws and inconsistent interpretations of the
Personal Data Protection Act hinder effective data sharing.

# Country overview

## Legal background and landscape

Thailand, formerly known as "Siam", is among a handful of Asian
countries to have avoided colonization by Western powers. Nevertheless,
it was indirectly forced to adopt Western legal systems and traditions
to abolish the "extraterritorial jurisdiction" granted to citizens of
Western nations.[^1] Consequently, in the 19th century, Thailand
underwent a modernization of its legal systems, with special reference
to the legal frameworks of France, Germany, and Japan, to align them
with those of the Western world.[^2] The 2017 Thai Constitution is the
supreme law of the land. It defines the structure of the Thai
government, including the roles of the monarchy and the legislature.
Importantly, it guarantees the rights and liberties of the Thai people,
including those related to data governance, such as the right to freedom
of expression, the right to access information held by government
agencies, and the right to privacy, which underpins the personal data
protection framework.

At present, Thailand regards itself as a "civil law country", focusing
on statutory law instead of relying on judicial decisions as in common
law jurisdictions. It should be noted that Thailand is a unitary state,
not a federal one. In terms of hierarchy, the Thai Constitution holds
the highest position as the supreme law. Legislative elements, such as
codes, acts, decrees, ministerial regulations and departmental
announcements etc. occupy a subordinate level, ensuring that their
content aligns with the provisions of the Constitution. While court
judgments hold practical influence, it is important to note that,
officially, they lack binding legal authority.[^3]

The policies and legal regulations relevant to data are the product of
piecemeal and disparate efforts by the Thai government from different
periods of time. Prior to the late 1990s, Thailand already had criminal
offences against disclosure of private secrets prescribed in the
Sections 322-325 of the Thai Criminal Code, which came into effect in
1956. These can be said to be early "jigsaw pieces" of the protection of
data (secrets). After several decades, in 1996, the Thai government
proposed "IT 2000" as the first national policy on ICT with the main
aims of improving economic and social competitiveness and preparing for
changes brought by the digital age.[^4] As regards legal infrastructure
in relation to ICTs, the National Electronics and Computer Technology
Centre (NECTEC) was commissioned to draft six ICT-related bills, among
which were bills concerning electronic transaction, personal data
protection, and computer crime.[^5]

While the foundation of ICT-related laws was laid down in the late
1990s, prolonged efforts to increase the transparency of public
administration initiated by Anand Panyarachun's cabinet (1991-1992)
became successful when the OIA was passed in 1997, during the government
of Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.[^6] It can be regarded as an important law in
relation to the openness of data and information, which was consistent
with Section 58 of the 1997 Thai Constitution that guaranteed people's
right to access public information in possession of governmental
agencies, which they could use to exercise their political rights
effectively.[^7] It should be noted that the right to access to public
information in the possession of government agencies is now guaranteed
by Section 41 of the 2017 Thai Constitution.

Three ICT-related laws --- namely, the Electronic Transactions Act
(No.4) B.E. 2562 (2019), the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560
(2017) and the PDPA --- and the OIA have contributed significantly to
the development of data-related framework beyond the secret
protection-related provisions in the Thai Criminal Code.

In addition to the OIA, the DPASDA also plays a significant role in
shaping the data governance framework, especially in the public sector.
It is the primary piece of legislation that establishes the strategies
and policies for the development and improvement of public
administration and services, which in turn serve as the legal basis for
the policies, standards, and practice guidelines pertaining to data
governance in the public sector. In 2020, DGDC, a body established by
the power of the DPASDA, issued the Announcement on Data Governance for
Government 2020, which aimed to be part of the implementation of the
DPASDA.[^8] The 2020 Announcement was arguably the first policy that
explicitly addressed data governance in Thailand. Given this, it can be
said that the focus on data governance in the public sector is primarily
driven by the Thai government's ambition to develop and achieve digital
government.

To sum up, presently, the Thai government has established a clear
framework and policies on data governance for the public sector. They
are aimed at enhancing the efficiency of public services and integrating
data and information held by various public agencies in a systematic,
consistent, and secure manner. In addition, the data governance
framework is expected to promote open data, accessible to the public.
Interestingly, from the Thai government's perspective, data governance
is viewed as a tool to accomplish, at the beginning, the development of
ICT legal infrastructure and national ICT competency, and subsequently,
more effective public administration and services; the latter is not the
goal in and of itself.

In contrast, however, the Thai government has left the data-related
framework in the private sector to be governed by a patchwork of
disparate laws, such as the provisions of the Thai Criminal Code, PDPA,
etc.[^9]

## Increasing openness/access

This section focuses on constitutional guarantees of the rights to be
informed by, and to access, public data or information held by the
public sector. As noted before, there is no legal requirement for the
private sector regarding openness and access to data.

### Open data and content

The 1997 Thai Constitution is widely recognized as the People's
Constitution, as a majority of Thai people participated in its drafting
from the very early stages.[^10] It was promulgated after Black May
1992, one of the most violent crackdowns on demonstrators and a moment
of significant political unrest in modern Thai history.[^11] The Black
May incident eroded Thai people's trust in their government[^12] and
intensified their demand for knowing and accessing information held by
government agencies.[^13] Currently, under the 2017 Thai Constitution,
Section 41(1)[^14] guarantees the right to be informed by and to access
public data or information held by the governmental agencies. On the
other hand, Section 59 makes it the duty of the Thai government to
disclose any public data or information and also ensure convenient
access to such data or information.[^15] As stated above, the Official
Information Act was arguably the first piece of legislation to address
the issue of data openness.

As regards the Announcement on Data Governance for Government 2020, it
is essential to examine the original policy paving the way to the
passage of the DPASDA. The 2017 Thai Constitution requires the National
Council for Peace and Order (the military junta established after the
2014 coup)[^16] to make a national masterplan on long-term overall
national development.[^17] The junta announced the 20-Year National
Strategy, which requires all succeeding governments to adhere to the
agendas therein from 2018 to 2037.[^18] The National Strategy's Agenda 6
on Public Sector Rebalancing and Development[^19] was translated into
the 12th National Economic and Social Plan 2017-2021, which *inter alia*
set a policy to improve the management of the public sector, prevent
corruption, and establish good governance with an aim to achieve
"transparent, effective, and accountable public administration".[^20]
This in turn paved the way for the Digital Development for National
Economic and Social Plan, one of whose aims is to advance digital
administration.[^21] As a consequence, a series of Digital Government
Development Plans were announced, including the first-phase plan
2016-2018,[^22] the second-phase plan (drafted for 2017-2021 but never
finalized),[^23] the third-phase plan (2020-2022)[^24] and the
fourth-phased plan (2023-2027).[^25] Notably, the DPASDA mandates the
establishment of the DGDC and the DGA as the Committee's administrative
and supporting body to implement measures in accordance with the Digital
Government Development Plans, as required by Sections 6 and 10 of the
DPASDA. As regards the data governance of public information policy,
Sections 7 and 8 require the DGDC to make policies on data governance of
the public sector and implement the relevant measures. In addition, all
government agencies are required by Section 12 to produce governmental
data at the departmental level to be in line with and integrated with
the data governance framework. The detailed policies and action plans
were set out in the third-phase Digital Government Development plan
(2020-2022).[^26] As mentioned above, the DGDC issued the Announcement
on Data Governance for Government 2020 as the first explicit policy and
legal framework with a view to increasing openness and access as part of
data governance, especially in the public sector.

#### The public sector

In this section, we discuss laws that make public data accessible.
First, we examine policies that mandate proactive disclosure. Then, we
turn to 'reactive' laws that enable data to be shared upon a specific
action, such as a citizen's request.

##### Proactive data disclosure in the public sector

As discussed above, the first laws to address transparency of data are
the OIA and the 1997 Thai Constitution, which are the consequence of the
violent political confrontations between the National Peace Keeping
Council (the junta) and Thai people in May 1992. Currently, the Office
of the Official Information Commission regulates, oversees, and monitors
how governmental agencies perform in relation to the disclosure of
official information. It also has the power to issue relevant
regulations, guidelines, measures, and practices.[^27]

The OIA is guided by the idea that "disclosure is the principle; secrecy
is the exception".[^28] Notably, just 10% of government-held public
information is readily accessible to the public (proactively), with the
remaining 90% disclosed only upon request (reactively).

The legal principles and policies deriving from the OIA can be
summarized as follows.[^29] First, all government agencies and public
officials are required to comply with all requirements imposed by this
law in order to safeguard the right to access public information, as the
exercise of political rights and freedom of expression is essential for
a healthy democracy. As a consequence, all government agencies are
required to compile data catalogs of the public information they possess
and make them available to the public through the Government Data
Catalog website
([[https://gdcatalog.go.th/]{.underline}](https://gdcatalog.go.th/)).[^30]
Second, a clear distinction is made between what information should be
made available to the public (the principle) and what information should
be withheld (the exceptions prescribed in Sections 14 and 15 of the
OIA). Under the Government Data Catalog Guideline Version 2, government
data is classified into five categories: Open, Private, Confidential,
Secret, and Top Secret. The last three categories align with those
defined by the OIA and by the Official Information Commission regarding
government secrecy, in order to avoid confusion with the Commission's
existing practices. However, it is important to note that the Government
Data Catalog Guideline Version 2 currently available online is marked as
a draft.[^31] The grounds of exception include national security, public
order and safety, the rights and reputation of others, and personal
data. Third, all government agencies and public officers should ensure
that the majority of information should be publicly available, subject
to the PDPA, and information that falls within the scope of exception
should comprise a small portion. According to the cabinet resolution of
29 April 2011, all information covered by Sections 7 and 9 of the OIA
must be made publicly available on the websites of all government
agencies[^32][^33].[^34] Last, as required by Section 33 paragraph 2,
all government agencies and public officers have to allow the Office of
the Official Information Commission or anyone assigned by the Commission
to access and assess the information in question, regardless of whether
it is publicly disclosable or not. To sum up, the OIA and the cabinet
resolution of 29 April 2011 have made the majority of public information
in the possession of government agencies (especially those on the lists
in Sections 7 and 9) available on the websites of individual government
agencies. To date, there has been no study assessing the effectiveness
of the cabinet resolution regarding compliance with Sections 7 and 9 of
the OIA. Not only does the Official Information Commission under the OIA
play a significant role in proactive data sharing, but so does the DGA,
a public organization whose mission is to establish an effective digital
government in accordance with the DPASDA. As previously stated, Section
59 of the Thai Constitution mandates the disclosure of any public data
or information possessed by governmental agencies. In addition, it must
ensure convenient access to such data or information. In 2015, the Thai
government initiated its Open Government Data project by commissioning
the Electronic Government Agency (EGA) to compile a list of types of
public information that need to be disclosed, and then ordering all
government agencies to provide the required public information on the
list for uploading to data.go.th.[^35] EGA was under the administration
of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society until 2018, when it was
renamed DGA and its administration was transferred to the Office of the
Prime Minister. This website is aimed to be "\[d\]eveloped under the
concept of being the central point for accessing open government data,
allowing citizens to conveniently and rapidly access government data at
all times. The published dataset should be in a structured format such
as CSV, XLS, XLSX, XML, or JSON to ensure it is fully machine-readable.
Additionally, data sets and metadata can also be managed."[^36] [^37]

This one-stop information website contains information pertinent to
culture, law and justice, education, economy and finance, public health,
official statistics, agriculture, social welfare, transportation and
logistics, politics, science and technology, and local and regional
affairs among other topics. It is still extremely active, with 3,878,375
users and 14,920,495 downloads as of 9 October 2023.[^38]

The National Statistical Office of Thailand (NSO) also plays a crucial
role in the country's data governance framework.[^39] Under Section 6 of
the Statistics Act B.E. 2550 (2007), the NSO is responsible for
preparing, collecting, and creating national statistics.[^40]
Furthermore, as stipulated by Section 8(5) of the DPASDA and a Cabinet
resolution from 7 May 2019, all government agencies are required to
collaborate with the NSO, a division of the Ministry of Digital Economy
and Society, to create data catalogs focused on statistical and
directory services.[^41] These statistics are then made publicly
available on catalog.nso.go.th, covering a range of topics including
logistics, energy, consumption, science and technology, demography,
social welfare, religion, and culture. Currently, 752 sets of
statistical data are accessible through this platform.

Importantly, apart from dealing with open data or statistical data, the
NSO has been appointed by DGDC as the national registrar for all types
of government data catalogs. Meanwhile, the DGA manages data.or.th, the
central platform for open data, as specified by the DPASDA.

In practice, however, most government agencies have so far posted data
catalogs for open data only. This is because all government agencies are
driven by KPIs set out by the Office of the Public Sector Development
Commission (OPDC). In the first phase of this initiative (2021-2023),
the primary objective was to build open data resources. The KPI for this
phase measured the number of open data sets cataloged on the NSO website
and made available on data.or.th or agency-specific sites, following
DGA's data governance guidelines.

Starting from the second phase (2024), the KPIs have shifted focus to
encourage data sharing among government agencies. Key agencies are now
expected to share "master data" with other agencies, and the KPI will
reward data sets that are beneficial across multiple agencies. This
shift reflects a broader objective: data governance as a tool for
inter-agency collaboration and resource-sharing, rather than an end in
itself.

As far as data openness on websites of government agencies is concerned,
the 2021 Government Website Standard Handbook issued by EGA sets
guidelines for the content that government agency websites should
include.[^42] It specifies that a government agency website should
provide information such as the organization's history or background,
aims and vision, information about the CEO, and relevant laws and
regulations.

As a part of proactive approaches to government open data, two other
initiatives are worth mentioning. First, the Office of the National
Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) conducts an annual Integrity and
Transparency Assessment (ITA), with open data as one of its criteria.
The NACC specifies which types of government information must be
publicly accessible according to the OIA and government policy. DGA has
advocated for integrating its open data standard into these datasets to
enhance public accessibility through machine-readable formats.
Additionally, DGA has recommended that agencies conduct public surveys
to understand the demand for open data. If agencies release data based
on this demand, they can claim this as fulfilling the ITA's open data
requirement.

Another major initiative is the Law Portal, launched by the Office of
the Council of State in partnership with DGA. This online platform
provides access to all legislations and related decrees, allowing users
to search and cross-reference laws, decrees, and subordinate
regulations.[^43]

Interestingly, there is no open access mandate for scholarly literature
imposed by either governmental agencies or private funders. Open access
is based on voluntariness and collaboration between the Ministry of
Higher Education, Science, Research, and Innovation and educational
institutions. The main scheme is the ThaiLIS Digital Collection (TCD),
which serves as a repository of dissertations, theses, and research
reports from numerous colleges and universities nationwide. ThaiLIS is
supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research, and
Innovation.[^44] Thailand also has an academic journal database, Thai
Journals Online (ThaiJO), which is supported by Thailand Science
Research and Innovation (TSRI), an agency under the Ministry of Higher
Education, Science, Research and Innovation, National Electronics and
Computer Technology Center, Thai-Journal Citation Index Center,
Thammasat University and King Mongkut's University of Technology
Thonburi.[^45] With regard to geo-informatics, the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment is the main government agency responsible for
making this information available. It can be accessed via
data.go.th.[^46]

##### Reactive data disclosure in the public sector

The OIA is also the principal piece of legislation governing reactive
data disclosure. Under this law, public information in the possession of
government agencies can be divided into three categories: namely,
information that is proactively made available to the public (which
makes up only 10%, as discussed in the proactive data openness section
above); information that falls within the scope of exception and thus
cannot be disclosed (Sections 14 and 15 of the OIA); and information
that is not within the scope of the first two (Section 11 of the OIA).
The final category refers to public information that is disclosed upon
request, which accounts for 90% of all public information.[^47]
Currently, significantly more data is disclosed reactively than
proactively. Reactive disclosure of data is subject to exceptions set
forth in Article 15 of the OIA. These exceptions include cases where
disclosure would cause damage to national security, interstate
relationships, national economic and financial stability, impede the
enforcement of other laws, endanger life or safety, or violate privacy.
Additionally, under the PDPA, the disclosure of personal data without
the consent of the data subject is prohibited.

#### The private sector

There is no uniform policy or framework regarding data and content
openness in the private sector. Moreover, data and information of
private companies and organizations can be disclosed through the legal
frameworks of the OIA and the PDPA. For companies that are not public,
the Department of Business Development has a duty to make publicly
available information regarding company registration, financial
statements, shareholder registration, and business collateral
registration (on the department's website). Likewise, the public can
access information on charitable and non-profit organizations by using
the OIA. However, this is subject to the PDPA. For public companies,
Article 24/1 of the Securities Exchange Act, 1992, requires the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose information
concerning the issuance or offering for sale of securities, the
companies issuing or offering securities, securities companies, the
Securities Exchange, over-the-counter centers, organizations related to
the securities business, or information relating to any violations and
penalties imposed on violators. This includes any other information
obtained in the performance of duties under this Act, such as current
information, financial statements, and reports on the financial status
and operating results of public companies that offer shares to the
public (as required by Article 56).

##### Trade agreements

At present, Thailand has bilateral free trade agreements with six
different countries, namely Australia, Chile, India, Japan, New Zealand,
and Peru.[^48] With regard to open access to law and open data relating
to macro-economics, according to Article 7 of the Framework Agreement on
Closer Economic Partnership between the Government of the Republic of
Peru and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, both Thailand and
Peru are required to "ensure that \[their\] laws, regulations and basic
economic data are made available, for example via the Internet, in such
a manner as to enable the other Party to become acquainted with them.
Upon request from the other Party, a Party will endeavour to promptly
provide information and respond to questions pertaining to any actual or
proposed measure referred to in paragraph 1".[^49] In addition, certain
trade agreements require Thailand to have personal data protection
measures in place.

### Open standards and software

This section focuses on how Thai government agencies -- such as DGA and
DGDC -- ensure consistency in data format, quality, and
interoperability. Despite this, the use and promotion of open-source
software remain underdeveloped and underfunded.

#### The public sector

In Thailand, a ministerial or departmental announcement is a type of
secondary legislation that a department can issue within the scope
allowed by an act. By virtue of the DPASDA, the DGDC issued the
Announcement on Data Governance for Government on 12 March 2020
\[Digital Government Development Agency[^50]\].[^51] It serves as the
foundation for policies and legal measures that explicitly address data
governance. The announcement states clearly that the Thai government's
data governance serves as a set of principles and guidelines for all
government agencies to follow in order to develop systems that
effectively manage and integrate discrete and disparate pieces public
information, as well as safeguard them with reliable data security
mechanisms.[^52] Besides the announcement, DGA also issued the Data
Governance for Government Handbook version 1.0 in 2018. It provides
essential information about data governance in the form of the core
concepts, definitions, framework of data governance, data rules, metrics
and success measures, data quality and security assessments as well as
case studies of Australia, South Korea and the United Kingdom as good
models of data governance.[^53] In 2020, DGDC also issued the
Announcement on Disclosure of Public Sector Information in Digital
Format to the Public and the 2020 Handbook.[^54] The aim of this
announcement is to mandate all government agencies to make the
information in their possession ready for public availability and free
of charge. The handbook accompanying the announcement provides a set of
guidelines to ensure standardization in how data is made accessible,
usable, and shareable. It also specifies the file formats used to store
and exchange data, ensuring the data can be accessed and used without
proprietary constraints, with an expectation that the information will
be circulated and utilized for wider benefits and interests.
Furthermore, the announcement requires the establishment of a central
information center, which will serve as a liaison and facilitator
between various government agencies in order to make public information
available to the public.[^55] The handbook contains details regarding
the nature of information that is disclosed, the criteria that should be
taken into account when evaluating whether public information is ready
to be made available, the procedure for making information publicly
available, the designated center for public information, and potential
applications of public information.[^56]

In 2023, DGA issued the Data Governance for Government Handbook version
2.0 The second version incorporates several modifications and
supplementary content. These include updating definitions to align more
closely with the present circumstances, providing more details on data
governance and information categorization, modifying the criterion for
assessing data quality, incorporating guidance on how to implement a
data governance framework in practice, and supplementing the first
edition with clearer, step-by-step instructions to assist individual
government agencies. The second announcement is on Data Quality
Assessment Framework for Government Agencies 2023.[^57] Its handbook
aims to provide a framework and tools for assessing the quality of
public information in relation to data management, monitoring, and
control. Its main purpose is to provide users of public information with
the assurance that the data is accurate, reliable, and of sufficient
quality to be utilized for precise policy and operational
decision-making, as well as accurate analysis. The third announcement is
on Recommendations for Writing Data Management Policies.[^58] The
primary purpose of this announcement and its handbook is to serve as a
template for a data management model that individual government agencies
can refer to in developing their own data governance guidelines,
aligning with the data policies they have publicly declared.

The last one is the Announcement on Government Data Catalog and
Registration Guidelines 2023.[^59] There are two handbooks accompanying
this announcement. The Handbook on Government Data Catalog provides
information to the government agencies' technical and non-technical
teams regarding the creation of data catalogs (with metadata) that can
be supplied to the central database of public information. The Handbook
on Government Data Registration aims to furnish guidance that will
establish a standardized framework for the registration process of
diverse data catalogs.

In 2012, EGA published the first version of the Government Website
Standard Handbook with an expectation to establish a uniform criterion
that different government agencies could implement on their respective
organizational websites.[^60] This handbook contains information
regarding: 1. government website contents; 2. government data exchange
(i.e., how to integrate public information from various websites into a
one-stop-service platform or application.); 3. information security; 4.
recommended features (i.e., web designs and displays, languages (Thai
and English), fonts (the Thai government requires government agencies to
use 13 open-source fonts developed by Software Industry Promotion Agency
on their websites. Additionally, these fonts have also been promoted for
use in the private sector,[^61] web navigation system, pop-ups and tool
tips, web analytic tools, naming of files and directories, hyperlinks;
[^62] and 5. Phases of Online Service Development.[^63]

In 2021, the Government Website Standard Version 2.0 was released. The
second version of the handbook, like the first version, draws from
existing open standards such as WCAG 2.0[^64]. It contains information
on 8 issues: 1. website domain names; 2. basic organizational
information of a government agency; 3. organizational policies on open
government data; 4. services provided by a government agency; 5. public
participation (such as public relations, social interaction, public
hearing and online surveys); 6. recommended features; 7. website
security; and 8. relevant policies (such as website policy, privacy
policy, and website security policy).[^65] DGA motivates agencies to
adopt data governance practices through incentives and KPIs. One key
incentive is the annual Digital Government Award, led by the Prime
Minister, which recognizes government agencies that excel in advancing
their digital maturity, with specific categories for achievements in
open data and data governance. The OPDC's KPI serves as a mandatory
benchmark, requiring top-performing agencies to align with DGA's
data-related standards and to actively promote data usage. DGA not only
establishes and promotes these standards and guidelines but also
provides training for government employees. However, DGA is not a
regulatory or enforcement body; each government department is
responsible for implementing and adhering to the recommended standards
and guidelines.

In 2012, the Act on Carrying Out of Public Service via Electronic Means
B.E. 2565 (APSEM) was passed \[[ActCarrying2022]{.mark}\]. In essence,
the law grants citizens the right to access all government services and
related information online. It mandates that government agencies provide
these electronic services in line with standards approved by the
cabinet. Failure to comply may lead to charges of neglect of duty for
the responsible government officers, as outlined in Article 157 of the
Criminal Code. In addition, the law also empowers the OPDC to monitor
all government agencies every 15 days and to report to the cabinet every
two months on those agencies that have not implemented the required
measures.

The OPDC, Office of the Council of State, Electronic Transactions
Development Agency (ETDA), and DGA issued two handbooks on Carrying Out
of Public Service via Electronic Means. One edition is designed for
novices, while the other is intended for more experienced government
agencies \[Digital Government Development Agency[^66]\].[^67] These
handbooks provide guidelines regarding submission/receipt of petitions
or cases, contacting government agencies, sending/receiving electronic
documents, presenting evidence, and the preparation and verification of
licenses. Importantly, they also set standards for the format of
electronic documents to be in PDF, JPEG and BMP. Furthermore, in the
case that certification is necessary, the document in question needs to
be certified by the National Root Certification Authority of
Thailand.[^68]

The DGDC also issued another major standard called TGIX, with the aim of
standardizing data formats and data exchange protocols between
government agencies. TGIX contains both semantic and technical
standards. The semantic standards for natural (Thai) personal data and
address (location) data are already promulgated, with more planned to be
approved by DGDC soon.

#### The private sector

Similar to the public sector, Sections 7 and 10 of the Electronic
Transactions Act (No.4) B.E. 2562 (2019) requires private companies and
organizations to recognize and treat digital data or documents in the
same way as hard copies.

#### Free and Open-Source Software

The NECTEC is active in promoting open-source software, such as Linux
and OpenOffice.org.[^69] In the private sector, Thailand has the
Open-Source Education and Development Association (OSEDA) which aims to
promote the study and development of open-source software.[^70]
Unfortunately, at the moment, the Thai government does not give enough
importance to the development of open-source software.

## Decreasing openness/access

This section examines legal frameworks that restrict data access, often
citing national security, as seen in the Computer-Related Crime Act and
Official Secrets Rules. Further limitations arise from disinformation
laws, and data localization and retention requirements. It also reviews
the Personal Data Protection Act (2019), which aligns with
constitutional privacy rights but faces implementation challenges due to
ambiguous guidelines and limited enforcement capacity in both the public
and private sectors.

### National security and public order

Section 52 of the 2017 Thai Constitution makes it obvious that the Thai
government has a responsibility to *inter alia* protect national
security and public order. This clause allows the Thai government to
conduct intelligence operations. Furthermore, under the 2017 Thai
Constitution, constitutional rights and liberties may be restricted or
limited by law for the protection of national security and the
preservation of public order. The right to freedom of expression
(Section 34), freedom of travel (Section 38), and civil assembly
(Section 44) are, for instance, subject to the protection of national
security and the maintenance of public order. It is not surprising that,
in Thailand, national security and public order appear to be of
particular significance. Though Section 59 requires the Thai government
to make public information accessible and available, it also specifies
that the obligation to disclose public information does not apply to
information related to national security and state secrets.

Section 14(3) of the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560 (2017)
prohibits the entry of computer data deemed to constitute a national
security or terrorism-related offence. It is worth noting that the
information that falls under the purview of this provision does not need
to be false (disinformation). Even information that is true and accurate
can be restricted on the grounds that it threatens national security or
that publishing it would amount to a terrorism-related offence.

In addition, the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets B.E. 2544
(2001), the secondary legislation passed by the virtue of Section 16 and
Section 26 paragraph 5 of the OIA, lays down a practical framework of
how to categorize and treat different types of "official secrets". Under
this Rule, official secrets, i.e., public information not subject to be
the disclosure requirement of the OIA \[Section 5 of the Rule on
Maintenance of Official Secrets B.E. 2544 (2001)\], are classified into
three different groups, namely confidential, secret, and top-secret
information \[Section 12 of the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets
(2001)\]. Confidential information refers to classified information
that, if disclosed in whole or in part, would cause damage to the
interests of the state \[Section 5 of the Rule on Maintenance of
Official Secrets (2001)\]. Secret information means classified
information that, if disclosed in whole or in part, would cause serious
damage to the interests of the state \[Section 5 of the Rule on
Maintenance of Official Secrets (2001)\]. Lastly, top-secret information
refers to classified information that, if disclosed in whole or in part,
would cause the most serious damage to the interests of the state
\[Section 5 of the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets (2001)\].
According to the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets (No.2) B.E.
2561 (2018), heads of government agencies (such as individual heads of
departments, provincial governors, Bangkok governor, directors or
general managers of state enterprises, and the chief executive officers
of organizations -- for example, the Attorney General, the
Secretary-General of the Office of the Judiciary, the Secretariat of The
House of Representatives, and the Chairperson of the Lawyer Council of
Thailand) have the power to determine the classification level of
specific information within their respective organizations.[^71] They
are also required to provide justifications for labelling information
categories (i.e., types of particular pieces of information such as
civil-related, military-related, public health-related, financial and
economic information) and classification levels (i.e., a confidential,
secret or top-secret level). Notably, Section 16 of the Rule on
Maintenance of Official Secrets (2001) was not amended by the Rule on
Maintenance of Official Secrets (No.2) (2018). This classification and
categorization are vital for protecting sensitive information and
ensuring that it is handled properly in accordance with the nature,
characteristics, and impact of its disclosure or leakage. Moreover, the
National Intelligence Agency has responsibility for the security and
preservation of civil-related official secrets,[^72] the Armed Forces
Security Center is responsible for military-related secrets,[^73] and
the Special Branch Bureau of Royal Thai Police is responsible for
police-related secrets[^74] \[Section 11 of the Rule on Maintenance of
Official Secrets (No.2) (2018)\].

The final piece of legislation to be discussed here is the National
Intelligence Act B.E.2562 (2019). The data and information derived from
intelligence operations is technically "public information". However,
such public information is of a sensitive nature, and its disclosure or
leakage could have detrimental effects on national security and public
order. Therefore, information derived from intelligence operations is
typically classified as a state secret and is not made public.

#### Disinformation

In Thailand, Section 14 (1) and (2) of the Computer-Related Crime Act
(No.2) B.E.2560 (2017) are two main provisions to combat disinformation.
Section 14(1) makes it a criminal offence for a person to "dishonestly
or by deception, \[enter\] wholly or partially distorted or false
information or content in the form of computer data into a computer
system in a manner likely to cause damage to the general
public...".[^75] Section 14(2) also criminalizes the entry of "false
computer data into a computer system in a manner which is likely to
cause damage to the protection of national security, public safety,
economic safety of \[Thailand\], infrastructures which are for public
benefit; or to cause panic to the general public".[^76] It can be
concluded that in Thailand, internet-based disinformation that may cause
harm to the general public, vital national security and infrastructure,
or panic among the populace is subject to criminal penalties.
Furthermore, in 2019, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society
established the Anti-Fake News Center Thailand with the dual purpose of
disseminating information regarding disinformation, and serving as a
platform for the public to report instances of disinformation.[^77]

#### Data localization

At present, Thailand does not have a specific law that requires
non-personal data to be stored, processed, or handled within the
country's border. However, the PDPA has a regulation on the transfer of
personal data outside Thailand (for details see below). Additionally,
the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society has commissioned the Office
of National Digital Economy and Society to study and propose a
Cloud-First Policy, which in turn commissioned the Thailand Development
Research Institute (TDRI) to come up with a report and recommendations
including data sovereignty and data residency policy proposals. But
there is no concrete policy or specific law for data localization yet.

#### Data retention

There are two main laws which regulate data retention: Computer-Related
Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560 (2017) and the PDPA. An Internet service
provider is required by the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560
(2017) to retain traffic data (which refers to any data related to
computer system communications, including details about the
communication's origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration,
type of service used, or other relevant information regarding the
computer system's communication) for at least 90 days from the date the
data entered the computer system. Failure to comply with this
requirement can be punishable with an administrative fine not exceeding
THB 500,000. It does not have extra-territorial applicability. In
addition, it must store the user's data, for identification purposes,
for at least 90 days after expiration date of a service \[Section 26 of
the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560 (2017)\]. The PDPA makes
it compulsory for data controllers to specify the period of data
retention (in accordance with the purpose of the personal data
collection) and inform data subjects prior to or during the consent
request \[Section 23(3) of PDPA\]. In addition, data controllers have a
duty to delete or destroy personal data after the data retention period
has expired \[Section 37(3) of PDPA\]. It should be noted that PDPA does
not provide leeway for data controllers to retain data indefinitely.

Interestingly, data retention is related to the archiving regulation set
out by the Official Information Commission (OIC) and National Archives
of Thailand. As OIC and other laws regarding government data or
information deal with information in the form of paper documents,
treating data largely means opening or destroying the whole document. On
the other hand, data mentioned in the DPASDA, the Computer Crime Act and
the PDPA deal with each data set and data field as a unit regardless of
its physical form.

### Privacy Protection of personal data and taxpayer information

#### Protection of individual rights and personal information

Provisions in the Thai Criminal Code related to the disclosure of
private information and secrets decrease data openness. Section 322
makes it a criminal offence for a person to "\[break\] open or \[take\]
away the closed letter, telegram or any document belonging to the other
person so as to ascertain or to disclose its contents, if such act to be
likely to cause injury to any person".[^78] Section 323 focuses on
secrets deriving from duties or occupations. It is a criminal offence
for a person who "knows or acquires a private secret of another person
by reason of his functions as a competent official or his profession as
a medical practitioner, pharmacist, druggist, midwife, nursing
attendant, priest, advocate, lawyer or auditor, or by reason of being an
assistant in such profession, and then discloses such private secret in
a manner likely to cause injury to any person".[^79] Under Section 324,
a person is subject to criminal punishment if "on the ground that
oneself having the duty, professing to call the trust, having known or
acquired the secret according to industry, discovery or scientific
invention, disclosing or using such secret for the benefit of oneself or
other person".[^80] Section 325 makes the aforementioned offences
compoundable offences. These provisions are based on traditional
criminal offences aiming to protect certain types of secrets, and came
into effect several decades prior to the introduction of data
transparency (OIA, PDPA) and the framework of data governance in the
public sector (DPASDA).

As far as personal data protection is concerned, in 2010 the ETDA issued
the Announcement on the Guideline of Government Agency's Personal Data
Protection.[^81] This guideline applies only to government agencies. In
essence, it requires government agencies to handle people's personal
data in a proper manner, including through the limited collection of
personal data, identification of purposes of personal data collection
and storage, prohibition of the use and disclosure of personal data in
ways that are different from the purposes of personal data collection,
the requirement of data security, notification of the storage of
personal data to data subjects and the liabilities of data controllers.
Interestingly, certain provisions of this announcement bear resemblance
to those specified in the PDPA. The 2010 Announcement was a predecessor
of the PDPA, whose application was limited to government agencies.

As regards personal data protection in general, Section 32 of the 2017
Thai Constitution guarantees the right to privacy and the protection of
personal data. The PDPA is consistent with this constitutional
guarantee. As discussed previously, the draft of personal data
protection law was one of six ICT-related drafts introduced in the late
1990s. However, while the Electronic Transactions Act B.E.2544 (2001)
and the Computer-Related Crime Act B.E.2550 (2007) came into effect, the
personal data protection law was still in the legislative process. In
December 2018, the Bill on Personal Data Protection was proposed to the
National Legislative Assembly by the military junta at the 91/2561
Assembly; and the PDPA was promulgated and came into effect in February
2019.[^82] However, due to concerns that the public and private data
controllers and processors might not be at the technical and
technological capacity required, as well as due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the full enforcement of the PDPA was postponed until 1 June
2022.[^83] According to the Thai government, the postponement of the
enforcement of the PDPA will ensure that people's right to privacy and
personal data as guaranteed by the 2017 Thai Constitution will be
properly protected, reduce and limit injuries caused by violations of
personal data, make the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of
personal data meet international standards, especially the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU, ensure legal measures that are
in line with other countries are in place, and increase transparency and
good governance in relation to personal data[^84] .[^85] As with other
countries' personal data protection laws, the PDPA stipulates that
personal data cannot be collected, processed, used, or disclosed without
the data subject's consent. However, it should be noted that Section 4
provides exceptions to the applicability of the PDPA.[^86] This means
that in certain circumstances personal data can be lawfully collected,
processed, and disclosed without consent.

The PDPC issued the Guideline for Requesting Consent, which provides
guidance on various matters, including the process by which a data
controller may request consent from a data subject, the specific
information that ought to be presented to the data subject during the
consent request process, and the appropriate course of action in
response to consent revocation[^87] It should be noted, however, that
this principle is subject to certain exceptions, including national,
financial, or public safety, trial and adjudication, etc.

According to PDPC's Announcement on the Appointment of a Data Protection
Officer under Section 41 (2) of the Personal Data Protection Act B.E.
2562 in 2023,[^88] the data controller and data processor who have
activities involving the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data
on a large scale (over 100,000 individuals) are required to appoint
their own data protection officers. This provision is applicable to the
data controller and data processor who collect, use, or disclose
personal data for the purpose of behavioral advertising through search
engines or online social media platforms.

As far as AI and personal data are concerned, the PDPA is the primary
legislation that safeguards individuals' personal data in Thailand. It
does not include any specific provisions related to web scraping or AI
training. However, Section 4(3) of the Act specifies that it does not
apply to the use of personal data collected solely for activities
related to mass media, fine arts, or literature, provided these
activities adhere to professional ethics or serve the public interest.
This suggests that web scraping and the extraction of personal data
already available from such activities are not regulated by the PDPA.
However, the use of personal data on a large scale to train AI, which
does not fall within the scope of Section 4(3), appears to contravene
the PDPA. Importantly, the Personal Data Committee and the legislative
body have not issued an announcement or guidelines to specifically
address the use of personal data to train AI yet. It remains to be seen
whether the PDPA Committee or the Thai court will address this in the
future.

It is noteworthy that Thailand's obligation to implement legal measures
for protecting personal information and data is stipulated in several
trade agreements. Specifically, this requirement is detailed in Article
1106.1 of the Australia -- Thailand Free Trade Agreement, Articles 10.7
and 11.7 of the Peru -- Thailand Free Trade Agreement, and Article 10.5
of the Thailand -- New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership Agreement.

#### Transfer of personal data to foreign countries

Section 28 of the PDPA regulates the transfer of personal data from
Thailand to other countries. This provision requires the destination
country or international organization to have "adequate" data protection
standards and also implement appropriate safeguards to protect personal
data while it is being transferred and stored outside of Thailand. In
December 2023, the Personal Data Committee issued the Announcement on
the Criteria for Protecting Personal Data Sent or Transferred
Abroad.[^89] Section 5 of the announcement requires the Personal Data
Committee to consider two main factors. The first pertains to whether
the country or international organization receiving personal data has
legal measures or mechanisms aligned with the PDPA. This involves
specific requirements for the data controller, including the need to
have suitable security and personal data protection measures, the
capability to implement measures safeguarding the rights of data
subjects, and an effective remedy.

The second factor pertains to whether the country or international
organization has a regulatory body responsible for personal data
protection with the power to enforce legal or regulatory measures for
data protection. Under Section 6 of the announcement, the data
controller seeking to send or transfer personal data abroad can file a
request to PDPC for an evaluation of the "suitable safeguards to protect
personal data" in the foreign country or international organization.
Alternatively, the Office of PDPC also has the authority to initiate the
evaluation without a formal request from the data controller.
Interestingly, the announcement and the website of the Office of the
Personal Data Committee have not yet provided details regarding the
necessary documents, the procedural steps, or the expected waiting
period.

#### The PDPA, search engines, AI developers, and journalism

Search engines are currently subject to the legal framework of the PDPA
as part of the communications, telecommunications, computer, and digital
sectors.[^90] Legally speaking, all requirements prescribed under the
PDPA --- such as obtaining the data subject's consent, the duties and
responsibilities of data controllers and processors, and the rights of
data subjects --- are applicable to search engines operating in
Thailand.

As of now, there are no official legal documents or guidelines from PDPC
specifically addressing how PDPA requirements apply to search engines.
This results in ongoing ambiguity regarding how search engines collect
and process personal data, including the legality of scraped personal
data. Furthermore, although Section 33 of the PDPA introduces the right
to be forgotten, enabling individuals to request the deletion or
anonymization of their personal data from search engine results, there
is no official guidance on its implementation, leaving the issue
unresolved.[^91]

Nonetheless, in 2022, Google Cloud (not the search engine business)
published a white paper outlining its compliance with the Thai Personal
Data Protection Act. The paper emphasized Google Cloud's commitment to
providing its services in alignment with the PDPA and to working with
its customers to ensure that all services and their usage conform to the
Act's requirements.[^92]

As far as journalists are concerned, Section 4(3) clearly states that
the PDPA does not apply to the activities of mass media and journalism
carried out in accordance with professional ethics or for the public
interest. Thus, journalists and news agencies are still allowed to
collect, use, and disclose personal data in the name of public interest,
such as in cases of crime, corruption, etc.

Regarding the use of personal data to train AI, as in the case of search
engines, AI developers are subject to all legal requirements set forth
in the PDPA. However, there are not yet any specific legal regulations
or official guidelines from the PDPC.

#### Protection of taxpayer information

Under Section 10 of the Thai Revenue Code, the disclosure of taxpayer
information is strictly restricted. Revenue officials who obtain
information about taxpayers or related individuals through their
official duties are barred from sharing such details with others or
making them public, unless the requester is legally permitted to access
the information.[^93]

While the Official Information Act of 1997 promotes transparency by
affirming that government-held information should generally be
accessible, with confidentiality as an exception, this principle is not
absolute. Specific types of information are shielded from disclosure
when release could potentially harm national security or infringe on
important private interests. For instance, taxpayer-related information
-- recognized as personal data -- is explicitly protected and excluded
from disclosure under the Act.[^94] Nonetheless, according to the last
sentence of Section 10, taxpayer information may be disclosed if
permitted by other laws -- for example, when such disclosure is made
under a court judgment or order, explicitly authorized by statute,
carried out in the public interest, or undertaken as part of the data
controller's official duties in exercising state authority.

### Intellectual property law and data

This section explores the legal issues concerning data and copyright
laws, including a discussion on AI.

#### Copyright law in Thailand

The Copyright Act (No.5) B.E. 2565 (2022), the Patent Act (No. 3) B.E.
2542 (1999), the Trademark Act (No.2) B.E. 2543 (2000), and the Trade
Secret Act B.E. 2545 (2002) have certain provisions which prohibit the
disclosure of data to the public.[^95]

As far as copyright and research are concerned, Section 32 (1) of the
Copyright Act provides an exemption for using copyrighted work for
research on the condition that such research is not for profit.

The Copyright Act does not specifically address web scraping. As a
result, general copyright principles apply. This implies that web
scraping activities that extract copyrighted content without the
permission of the copyright owners, and does not fall under the
exceptions outlined in Section 32 of the Act (such as personal use,
research, academic purposes, teaching, school examinations, criticism,
or news reporting), could be considered a violation of copyright. It is
important to note that, at present, neither the Department of
Intellectual Property (DIP) nor the Central Intellectual Property and
International Trade Court have provided any guidance on the use of
copyrighted material to train AI yet.

Notably, however, Sections 43/1 and 43/5 offer exemptions for search
engines ("those who provide services of computer data location tools"),
if they meet the following conditions:

"(1) the service \[providers provide\] services of locating computer
data on the internet without knowing, or having a reasonable ground to
know, that the computer data are infringing and expeditiously removes
the reference or link to the computer data claimed to be infringing from
the computer system or network or disables access to the reference or
link to such computer data upon obtaining knowledge or notification of
such copyright infringement;

\(2\) the service \[providers do\] not receive a financial benefit
directly from the copyright infringing activity if the \[service
providers have\] the right and ability to control such copyright
infringing activity; and

\(3\) the service \[providers make\] available a means for receiving
notifications, and provide information on the name, address, telephone
number and electronic mail address, for contacting purposes, of the
service \[providers\] or the person designated to receive notification,
in a location easily accessible".[^96]

##### Copyright law and AI

The DIP makes it clear that it does not recognize the copyright of work
purely generated by AI. However, it may recognize such work if it is
generated by AI with the involvement or interference of a human
creator.[^97] Nevertheless, the DIP and the Central Intellectual
Property and International Trade Court have not provided any comments
regarding copyrighted work used to train AI yet**.**

In my opinion, the infringement of copyright occurs when someone uses
other people's copyrighted work without permission for commercial or
profit-making purposes. However, the key consideration is that the
violating work must be an exact copy or an altered version of the
copyrighted work. In this case, AI simply relies on copyrighted work for
training to "generate new work" that has distinctive features of its own
and differs significantly from the original work. The use of copyrighted
work to train AI may not violate copyright as long as the output has
unique characteristics that differ from the original..[^98]

According to TDRI, the private sector sees the potential and welcomes
the opportunities provided by using big data to train AI, and vice
versa, using AI to manage big data.

## Learnings

### Policy frictions and trade-offs

The key friction in Thailand's data governance lies between the legal
obligation to disclose public information and the laws that permit
government agencies to withhold information based on national security
concerns and the protection of personal data. Section 41 of the 2017
Thai Constitution guarantees the right to access public information held
by government agencies, while Section 59 mandates the Thai government to
disclose public data and ensure easy access to it. The OIA is
instrumental in requiring government departments and organizations to
make public information available.

However, several laws create exceptions to this rule. Notable among
these are the Rules on Maintenance of Official Secrets (2001 and 2018),
the PDPA, and the Revenue Code, which prohibit the disclosure of
confidential taxpayer information. As a result, tax revenue data is
generally not shared with other agencies, except where it is permitted
by other laws (for example, through a court order, statutory
authorization, public interest, or the performance of official duties
involving state authority). As a result, the general principle of
information disclosure under the OIA and the constitutional rights to
public access are constrained by these exceptions, particularly on
grounds of national security and privacy protection.

In terms of trade-offs, although the 2017 Thai Constitution guarantees
the right to access public information held by government agencies and
obligates the government to disclose such data, Section 25 stipulates
that this right can be restricted to protect state security or prevent
the violation of others' rights. The Rules on Maintenance of Official
Secrets (2001 and 2018) and the PDPA permit government agencies to
withhold information on the grounds of national security and privacy
protection. Consequently, the right to access public information must
yield to the need to protect national security and privacy rights.

### Good practices and potential learnings

As mentioned in the Data Governance for Government Handbook accompanying
the 2020 Announcement, Thailand appears to recognize data governance
models in Australia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom as good
practices and sources for potential learning.

At the national level, both the Office of the Official Information
Commission and DGA provide online and offline training and workshops for
government agencies and the private sector.

### Policy development and capacity challenges

According to information from the Director of the Office of the Official
Information Commission (Thailand), the first prominent challenge in
relation to data governance in the public sector is that the
categorization of information prescribed in the OIA differs from that
set in the Announcement on Data Governance for Government 2020 (issued
under the DPASDA). Under the 2020 Announcement, information is
classified into four groups: public information, personal information,
national security-related information, and official secrets. However,
under the OIA, there are three types of official information: (1)
information that must be made publicly available (e.g. through online
data catalogues), (2) undisclosed information, and (3) information that
may be disclosed upon request. This discrepancy creates uncertainty for
government agencies when categorizing the data in their possession, as
they are required to comply with both frameworks.

Furthermore, under the 2020 announcement, all government agencies are
required to create data catalogs of the information they hold. The DGA
and the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission (OPDC) are
currently pushing for the registration of these catalogs to enable data
exchange across government agencies, which is expected to lead to the
release of more types of government data. Additionally, the disclosure
of official documents without revealing sensitive, secret, or personal
data can be achieved through techniques such as data masking and
anonymization. DGA is currently drafting a standard for anonymization,
which is pending approval by the Digital Government Development
Promotion Committee (DGDP).

However, many government agencies have not thoroughly reviewed their
documents. They tend to rely on brief summaries to generate data
catalogs, resulting in documents with diverse content being grouped
together due to similar summary descriptions. Consequently, public data
catalogs often fail to accurately reflect the diversity and specific
details of the original documents. Given the volume and variety of
government records, it is not surprising that the number of catalogs is
lower than it should be. Moreover, since the available catalogs contain
only condensed summaries rather than full information, individuals may
have difficulty locating specific details or identifying documents in
their requests. As a result, some requests are rejected by government
agencies due to their ambiguity.

Another problem is that current data catalogs do not include full lists
of the documents they cover. Some of the listed documents may be
classified. Even when individuals know that the information they seek is
contained in a particular catalogue, they may be unaware that it cannot
be disclosed. Their requests may then be rejected on these grounds. This
has led to a breakdown of trust between the public and government
agencies. For example, consider a person seeking information on public
building project budgets in their village. They know this information is
in Data Catalog A, but the catalog also contains documents related to
classified military budgets. If the person submits a request for Catalog
A without realizing it includes classified content, their request may be
denied in full. Public officers may assume the requester is asking for
access to all included documents. This situation arises because data
catalogs do not specify the full list of documents or clearly indicate
which ones are public and which are classified.

In the private sector, the main challenge is the lack of clear and
detailed guidelines for businesses to comply with the PDPA, despite
mandatory compliance. As a result, many businesses are uncertain whether
they are meeting legal requirements, especially when adopting unfamiliar
data practices. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises are
often reluctant to invest in internal data governance systems. The
absence of comprehensive guidance from regulatory authorities --
particularly PDPC -- has left companies unsure whether their systems and
tools are legally compliant.

In addition, some interviewees identified the prevailing negative
perception of data governance among executives, officers, and
practitioners in both public and private sectors as a key barrier to
progress. Many still regard data governance as an unnecessary burden,
failing to appreciate its importance. Although the law requires them to
develop policies and implement data governance measures, the sheer
volume of data and documents they manage makes these tasks feel
overwhelming. Moreover, both professionals and the general public in
Thailand often lack a clear understanding of data governance principles.
Knowledge-sharing mechanisms on this topic are also inadequate and
ineffective across sectors.

Despite these challenges, the Bank of Thailand (BoT) has successfully
adopted data governance policies and standards aligned with national
guidelines. In 2023, BoT received the Digital Government Award for
Excellence in Data Governance from the Prime Minister, presented by DGA,
demonstrating strong commitment and cooperation from leadership and
staff.

In summary, both the public and private sectors must allocate time,
budgets, and personnel to meet legal data governance requirements.
Investments in appropriate tools and technologies are essential, and
staff must receive proper training to manage large volumes of data
effectively. These remain significant challenges for the implementation
of data governance in Thailand.

# Sectoral deep dives

This section delves into the application of data governance across key
sectors. In the public health sector, the National Health Security
Office attempts to balance openness and privacy but faces limited
capacity and unclear policy direction. In the financial sector, the Bank
of Thailand has promoted open banking and digital statement sharing,
although overlapping laws and inconsistent interpretations of the PDPA
hinder effective data sharing.

## Data governance in the national public health sector

The Ministry of Public Health plays a significant role in making
policies on data governance in the public health sector. In March 2022,
the Ministry of Public Health issued its Ministerial Order No. 378/2565
to commission its Information and Communication Technology Center to
regulate the ICT infrastructure in relation to digital data of public
health, especially data security (Health CIRT).[^99] It also announced
the Information Security Management System Policy to ensure data
security by providing a guideline and training for public health
personnel.[^100] At the national level, in September of the same year,
Anutin Charnvirakul, the then Ministry of Public Health, announced the
policies on public health, one of which was the development of a digital
health data system with the aim of integrating scattered health data
into a big national database, allowing people to access health-related
information about, for example, how to prevent diabetes or types of food
that can boost immunity, and access public health services and
treatments across different health-care providers.[^101] This was
followed by the (Draft) Action plan for Thailand's digital health system
2023-2027, with the goals of fostering good data governance, building an
ecosystem for digital health data, integrating pertinent health data,
and improving data security for sustainable digital data for public
health.[^102] The document mentions that one of the aims is to increase
the decentralization of the public health service, making it available
to the wider public. However, it mainly addresses administrative
decentralization and does not provide any details on how this can be
achieved. It reads more like an aspiration rather than actionable
information for policy implementation.

This report considers the NHSO and private hospitals as representatives
of the public and private healthcare sectors respectively.[^103]

The NHSO is a public organization that is responsible for policy-making
and implementation in relation to the promotion of the health care
system under universal health coverage, ensuring that all people who
live in Thailand have access to health care. Among other goals, it aims
to achieve and implement an effective information system for
communications, an evidence-based system of health care delivery,
beneficiary registration facility, and a monitoring and evaluation
system".[^104]

Importantly, while the NHSO gave an interview, all private hospitals
that the researcher approached declined to participate in the interview,
due to internal policies. However, the researcher could interview a
legal consultant specialized in providing legal advice to private
hospitals and familiar with legal requirements in relation to data
governance \[Director of Digital Information Support Department,
National Health Security Office (Thailand) and Jompon
Pitaksantayothin[^105]\].[^106]

### Laws and policies

The laws and policies which the NHSO has to comply with can be divided
into 4 categories as follows:

• The first group is relevant to the implementation and operation of the
NHSO, which includes the 2017 Thai Constitution, the Official
Information Act 2540 (1997), DPASDA and the APSEM B.E. 2565 (2022).

• The second group is about information exchange and disclosure, which
includes DPASDA, the Recommendation on ICT Standard for Electronic
Transactions by the ETDA, and Open Government Data Guideline 2020 by
DGDC.

• The third group is about personal data protection which includes the
Official Information Act B.E.2540 (1997), the PDPA and the Announcement
on the Guideline of Government Agency's Personal Data Protection 2010 by
the ETDA.

• The final group is about secret protection, which includes the
National Intelligence Act B.E. 2562 (2019) and the Rule on Maintenance
of Official Secrets (No.2) B.E. 2561 (2018).

For the majority of private hospitals, the relevant laws with regard to
data governance that they have to comply with are the Social Security
Act B.E. 2533 (1990) and the Workmen's Compensation (No. 2) Act B.E.
2561 (2018), which make them liaise with the Social Security Office, and
the PDPA, which requires them to have data governance system to protect
personal data of the patient.

### Policy gaps and frictions

Similar to other government agencies, the NHSO is required by the
Official Information Act 1997 to make public information in its
possession accessible to the public. However, it is also obligated by
the PDPA to protect what it considers personal data of individuals. The
situation is further complicated by a general lack of understanding of
the PDPA, leading most public health agencies to hesitate in disclosing
information, even when such disclosure is not prohibited by law. This
misunderstanding makes it complicated and time-consuming for the public
or other government agencies to request information. The policy of
promoting information disclosure under the Official Information Act 1997
is at odds with how most government agencies interpret the PDPA, which
may be incorrect.

As for private hospitals, they generally do not face issues with policy
conflicts, as they are not subject to the Official Information Act of
1997. They only need to comply with the PDPA.

### Policy objectives, trade-offs, and their recognition

The NHSO recognizes the competing objectives of accessibility and
privacy, as required by laws concerning official information and
personal data protection. However, it does not have a clear strategy to
resolve this conflict. Currently, it is attempting to comply with both
laws as much as possible. In most cases, it has to give priority to the
protection of personal data.

Private hospitals are not required to disclose information in their
possession, as the Official Information Act of 1997 does not apply to
them. They only need to comply with the PDPA. Therefore, the trade-off
between accessibility and privacy protection is not an issue for them.

### Good practices and potential learnings

As the NHSO is a government agency, it adopts the DGA's Data Governance
for Government as best practice. The officers of the NHSO have been sent
to participate in both online and offline training sessions organized by
the DGA. There are a few examples in the healthcare sector of open data
sharing and data exchange. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department
of Disease Control, MOPH, reported COVID-19 cases daily with the data
anonymized. Data on home isolation and community isolation patients were
also shared with emergency medical service providers and hospitals for
efficient patient transfer, using the DGA-RC standard agreed upon among
related government agencies. Other examples include the open datasets on
road accident fatalities, which include anonymized individual details
and Global Positioning System (GPS) location of the accidents.

There are no specific best practices in the private healthcare sector.
The officers of private hospitals have the opportunity to participate in
workshops or training sessions offered by both private and governmental
organizations, such as private companies and public and private
universities.

### Policy development and capacity challenges

The NHSO faces several capacity challenges at the moment. The first one
is that different public health government agencies maintain identical
information in various systems and formats. Additionally, certain pieces
or sets of data are not complete, accurate, up-to-date and therefore not
ready to be used. Furthermore, due to insufficient (or weak) data
security mechanisms, certain officers can access particular sets of
information which are not relevant to them. Different sets of
information are still scattered in different government agencies'
possession, as the integration of information has not been achieved in
practice yet.

In addition, although the Thai government has issued several policies on
data governance, most of them are not systematic and clear, making it
difficult for relevant officers to implement in practice. The budgets on
procurement of technical tools are limited. The NHSO lacks technicians
and officials who have expertise in data management systems and policy
analysis to create a framework for data governance. The organizational
executives do not give enough importance to data governance within their
departments. There is a lack of comprehensive data management strategy.
Furthermore, there is a lack of processes or mechanisms to ensure that
government agencies adhere to laws and policies. Although all parts and
levels of the public sector are required to give importance to data
governance and should devote more time and budgets to pursue this goal,
at present, a number of government agencies have not yet truly and fully
recognized these matters.

For private hospitals, the major concern is how to satisfy the
requirements imposed by the PDPA, especially with regard to the request
for consent. Despite the fact that the Data Protection Committee has
issued a guideline regarding the process of obtaining consent, most
hospitals remain uncertain whether their internal procedures adhere to
the legal obligations. For example, after receiving consent from a
patient, a hospital may be uncertain as to whether it is necessary to
request for consent again before connecting its patient database to
external organizations, such as an insurance company or the Pao Tang App
(a Thai government-adopted e-service and wallet). Furthermore, there is
confusion regarding what qualifies as consent (such as a consent given
through a telephone), and how long the consent will be valid. In
addition, they do not know who manages the personal data of the patient
after consent is revoked. To sum up, most private hospitals lack
detailed and clear guidelines from law enforcement to comply with
policies and legal obligations imposed on them.

Moreover, they lack in-house officers who can handle personal data
effectively. As a result, they have to pay outsourcing companies and law
firms for legal advice and computer system settings. Even after
receiving legal advice and computer system settings, they lack the
ability to operate the systems. Moreover, when new problems or
difficulties arise, they have to request assistance from the law firms
again. Most officers are already engaged in routine duties. They do not
have time to and interest in learning about personal data protection,
which is new and out of the scope of their main responsibilities. As a
consequence, although they receive training, they are unwilling to
devote themselves to learning. Finally, most private companies see this
as additional and unnecessary costs. Thus, they do not want to invest in
this area.

## Data governance in the national banking and financial sector

At the national level, the Bank of Thailand (BoT) plays the main role in
making policies, regulations, and guidelines regarding data governance
for the bank and the financial sector. In 2021, BoT issued its Guideline
on Data Governance[^107] with an aim to promote the effective use of
financial data to develop and improve financial products and services
while protecting the personal information of clients against all
potential risks. In addition, the bank's Regulation on Information
Technology Risk, which aims to ensure that both bank and non-bank
payment service providers *inter alia* have proper IT risk management
plans to tackle cyber threats, was also issued in the same year.[^108]
Furthermore, BoT also promotes open banking and open data in the form of
digital bank statements. Open banking allows clients to manage their
personal financial data through digital channels with convenience,
especially with regard to the consent given to the banks to send their
data to third-parties (such as FinTech companies or government agencies)
under good data governance and the principle of secret protection.[^109]
As regards digital banking, BoT encourages commercial banks to provide a
service which makes it possible for a bank statement issued by one bank
to be sent digitally to another bank directly with a high level of
security and verification. Financial service customers can use a mobile
banking app to request bank statement data from their own bank and send
it directly to another bank that has requested the bank statement from
them.[^110]

### Public sector: Bank of Thailand (BoT)

#### Laws and policies

According to information from the Deputy Director of Data Management and
Analytics Department, BoT's data governance is subject to various laws
and policies, most of which are similar to those which regulate other
government agencies. The laws and policies in relation to data openness
include the Official Information Act 2540 (1997), DPASDA, and the
Announcement on Data Governance for Government 2020. For the law and
policies concerning the protection of personal information and state
secrets, the bank has to comply with the Rule on Maintenance of Official
Secrets (No.2) B.E. 2561 (2018) and the PDPA.[^111] However, as a
regulatory body, the bank also has power to promote plans for openness
of financial data and issue regulations on data governance and
information technology risk with which private financial institutions
have to comply.

There is a recent collaboration between the bank and DGA in implementing
the "Open Finance" policy, which transfers data from various government
sources to facilitate loan application for people lacking access to
financial services. The main concept is to utilize individual consent to
obtain their personal data currently in possession of government
agencies. The service has been launched to obtain individual water usage
or electricity usage and bill payment information from Metropolitan and
Provincial Electricity Authority and Metropolitan and Provincial
Waterworks Authority, and send it to financial institutions to consider
that individual for loan approval. This policy is planned to be expanded
to all other personal data held by government agencies.

#### Policy gaps and frictions

There are some conflicts of policies and legal requirements among
different government agencies in the financial sector. Firstly, the
DPASDA requires government agencies to share and connect databases among
the government agencies in the financial sector in general. However, due
to specific pieces of legislation which aim to restrict the disclosure
of financial data -- for example, the Financial Institution Business Act
B.E. 2551 (2008)[^112] and the Credit Information Business Act B.E. 2545
(2002)[^113] -- certain organizations, such as the National Credit
Bureau,[^114] are not allowed to disclose or share financial information
with other government agencies.[^115] Secondly, although BoT is subject
to the OIA, which requires making public information accessible to the
public, the PDPA prevents it from disclosing information that can be
considered personal data.

#### Policy objectives, trade-offs and recognition

BoT recognizes the trade-offs and must comply with the laws that
restrict the disclosure of financial and personal data, as discussed
above.

#### Good practices and potential learnings

BoT regards its Data Governance Guideline as a model of good practice
for financial institutions. It also encourages its officers to attend
the workshops and training programs organized by the DGA.

#### Policy development and capacity challenges

One of the most important challenges that BoT faces is the undeniable
fact that data governance is highly abstract and difficult to
understand. As a consequence, like in the public health sector, most
officers feel that it is a burdensome addition to their routine duties.
Additionally, although there has been some investment in technical
tools, technologies and human resources, it seems that the bank still
lacks a one-stop-service platform that would enable it to implement data
catalog registration, data search, right to access information
management, the monitoring mechanisms to follow and evaluate impacts
caused by the changes of data governance-related laws and policies, and
the proper evaluation process of quality of data.

As required by the DPASDA and the Announcement on Data Governance for
Government 2020, all government agencies in the financial sector have to
prepare and create data catalogs. As a result, the Thai government in
general and BoT in particular have invested more in both financial and
human resources. Moreover, it is a time-consuming and difficult task to
set a practical framework and to raise awareness of the importance of
data governance in individual organizations.

The inadequate understanding of the PDPA poses certain obstacles. Most
government agencies and other relevant organizations are uncertain about
the types of data and the extent to which such data can be disclosed and
shared with other agencies. As a result, in practice, the PDPA is
typically used as an excuse for refusing to share such information at
the beginning. BoT, despite being a regulatory body with legal
authority, also experiences this issue. Its requests for certain
information in the possession of other departments have occasionally
been rejected by those departments as they were unsure whether the
requested information could be disclosed. Erring on the side of caution,
they prefer to reject the requests initially, and provide information
only if the bank shows them evidence, such as specific legal provisions,
judgements or ministerial regulations, orders, or announcements.

### Private sector: Private banks

Individual private financial institutions that were approached refused
to be interviewed due to internal policies. However, the researcher
could interview a legal consultant specialized in providing legal advice
to private hospitals and familiar with legal requirements in relation to
data governance.

#### Laws and policies

The main piece of legislation that requires private banks in Thailand to
collect and submit personal financial information of their clients to
the National Credit Bureau is the Credit Information Business Act
B.E.2545 (2002). For the protection of personal information, they have
to adhere to the PDPA. In addition, they have to comply with BoT's
guidelines on data governance and the regulation on IT risk management.
Interestingly, certain commercial banks, for example Siam Commercial
Bank and Kasikorn Bank have their own organizational policies, some of
which address the transparency and data openness for shareholders and
clients[^116] .[^117]

#### Policy gaps and frictions

The main policy gap arises from the PDPA. Under this law, personal
financial information is not considered as sensitive data. Thus, it is
not handled with special protection as is the case for health-related
data (despite the fact that it is also a very important type of
information especially to financial institutions and their clients). In
addition, as regards data security, Section 37(1) requires banks to
"provide appropriate security measures for preventing the unauthorized
or unlawful loss, access to, use, alteration, correction or disclosure
of \[personal data\]".[^118] However, there are no detailed criteria or
evaluation guidelines for the banks to know whether the systems they are
using are regarded as "appropriate security measures" or not. This makes
them uncertain whether their implementation of their organizational or
internal data security systems is in line with the legal requirements.

#### Policy objectives, trade-offs and recognition

Commercial banks are not obligated to disclose the information they
hold, as the Official Information Act of 1997 does not govern them.
Their only requirement is to comply with the PDPA. Consequently, the
balance between accessibility and privacy protection is not a concern
for them.

#### Good practices and potential learnings

They regard BoT's guideline on data governance and the regulation on IT
risk management as good practices.

#### Policy development and capacity challenges

Although commercial banks do not want to violate the law, especially the
PDPA, compliance with the legal requirements imposed by this law also
means additional investments and costs. Furthermore, as mentioned above,
the law simply requires them to implement personal data protection
measures, and there is no detailed guideline or criteria for the
financial sector yet. As a result, banks are concerned that the measures
they are implementing may not be "appropriate" enough in the eyes of the
regulatory body (especially PDPC).

Like most private hospitals, the majority of commercial banks are trying
to comply with legal regulations. Nevertheless, most of them have to
depend on external law firms for legal counsel and on IT companies to
establish computer systems for them, imposing an additional financial
burden on them. As regards accessibility, they simply comply with the
laws. This means that, due to personal data protection law, in most
cases, they will not allow access to information. They will permit
access only when required to adhere to other laws or comply with law
enforcement authorities' orders. The issue of interoperability was not
mentioned by the interviewee, and no publicly available information on
this matter could be found during data collection for this report.

# Summary of findings

## Commonality & divergences in data governance architecture

In the public sector, the Thai government has established a unified
standard for the collection, processing, sharing, disclosure, and access
to public data held by government departments and agencies. This
initiative is guided by the DPASDA, with the DGA overseeing its
implementation. However, these efforts are influenced by other laws
aimed at safeguarding national security, such as the Rules on
Maintenance of Official Secrets of 2001 and 2018, as well as protecting
privacy rights, particularly under the Personal Data Protection Act of
2019. In contrast, private companies and organizations lack a similarly
clear and unified framework, and they are primarily governed by laws
like the Personal Data Protection Act of 2019.

For public data sharing, Thailand's main platform is the Open Government
Data of Thailand (data.go.th), which offers access to public data from
various government departments and organizations. Additionally, the
National Statistical Office of Thailand (https://www.nso.go.th/) plays a
key role in managing and providing access to public information. Among
developed countries, Thailand considers Australia, South Korea, and the
United Kingdom as good models of data governance. Furthermore, the
Personal Data Protection Act of 2019 is significantly influenced by the
EU's GDPR, especially the core principles regarding consent, the duties
of data controllers and processors, the rights of data subjects, and the
establishment of a supervisory authority.

##  Frictions within policies

Section 41 of the 2017 Thai Constitution guarantees the public's right
to access information held by government agencies, while Section 59
obligates the Thai government to disclose any public data or information
and ensure easy access to it. To support these constitutional
provisions, the Official Information Act of 1997 plays a crucial role by
requiring government departments and organizations to make public
information available to the public.

However, there are several laws that create exceptions to this general
rule. Notable among these are the Rules on Maintenance of Official
Secrets of 2001 and 2018, as well as the Personal Data Protection Act of
2019. As a result, the broad principles of information disclosure
outlined in the 1997 Act and the constitutional rights regarding public
access to information are constrained by these exceptions, particularly
on the grounds of national security and privacy protection.

## Trade-offs among data governance objectives

Although the 2017 Thai Constitution guarantees the right to access
public information in the possession of government agencies and requires
the government to disclose any public data or information, Section 25
makes it clear that to protect the security of the State or prevent the
violation of the rights of other persons, the right to access public
information can be restricted. The Rules on Maintenance of Official
Secrets of 2001 and 2018 (national security), as well as the Personal
Data Protection Act of 2019 (right to privacy), allow government
agencies to deny disclosure on the grounds of national security and
personal data protection.

Therefore, the right and freedom to access public information held by
government agencies involve a trade-off with the protection of national
security and the right to privacy.

## Innovations in data governance regimes

An innovation worth mentioning is the DPASDA. It provides legal and
practical frameworks for data governance in the public sector. By virtue
of this law, DGA is authorized to issue announcements and guidelines
(handbooks) on data governance.

However, apart from this, there is no evidence of legal or policy
innovation regarding data governance in Thailand, nor is there evidence
suggesting that Thailand has learned from other developing countries.

##  Policy development processes

Thailand had several data-related laws in place before the introduction
of data governance for governmental departments, aiming to both promote
data openness and restrict access to data for privacy, national
security, and crime prevention. These laws include the Thai
Constitution, the OIA, the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560
(2017), the PDPA, and the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets.
However, the landscape of data governance significantly changed with the
promulgation of the DPASDA.

The DPASDA mandates that all governmental agencies and departments
prepare and implement measures to create data catalogs of public
information and data in their possession. These catalogs must be entered
and integrated into a centralized data platform to make them available
to the public online. DGA is responsible for setting guidelines and
standards for the creation and integration of these data catalogs and
website portals. Despite the DPASDA, many governmental departments still
face several challenges in meeting the data governance requirements set
by DGA or complying with laws passed several decades ago. Additionally,
there was limited public participation in the legislative process, and
while the public could express opinions on more recent laws like the
DPASDA through the government's online platform, these opinions did not
significantly influence the final content of the law.

Government departments are required to integrate data governance into
their tasks, but most face capacity challenges such as a lack of
knowledge, insufficient budgets, human resources, technologies,
equipment, and willingness. Many are also unsure how to adjust existing
operational behaviors to align with the \"new\" requirements of data
governance, leading to a gap between government expectations and the
actual capacity of individual departments. In contrast, the private
sector, unlike public organizations, lacks clear and sufficient
guidelines for effective data governance. As a result, they often
attempt to comply with fragmented and disparate legislation, focusing
mainly on what is legally required, particularly concerning personal
data protection, without giving true importance to data governance as a
whole.

    also be had to the making of concession given to persons with low
    incomes, unless otherwise provided by specific law. The extent to
    which an alien may enjoy the right under this section shall be
    provided by the Ministerial Regulation."
