# 1 Introduction

This report is part of the Data for Development project which aims, *inter alia*, to create and mobilize new knowledge about tensions, gaps, and the evolution of the data governance ecosystem taking into account formal and informal policies and practices.

In today\'s digital age, data governance ecosystems play a crucial role in shaping our societies. These policies, laws, practices, behaviors, and technologies, ostensibly seek to govern data in ways that protect rights, foster innovation, enhance transparency, and ultimately promote democratic and inclusive governance. However, the reality is that data governance is complex and often fraught with challenges and internal contradictions, and this is true of South and Southeast Asia as well.

To seek to capture a bit of this complexity, we chose to focus on eight countries --- India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand --- which provide a mix of civil law legal tradition and common law legal traditions, ranging from large (India) to small (Sri Lanka), and with a mix of developmental statuses, ranging from lower middle income countries (LMIC) to upper middle income countries (Thailand) and even a higher income country (South Korea), with a variety of primary languages.

This synthesis report explores data governance regimes and their contributions to development and more democratic and inclusive societies. It examines the tensions that arise between various data-related policies, such as personal data protection, competition law, open data initiatives, cybersecurity measures, and AI and innovation strategies. While developed countries may have mechanisms to address these conflicts, many nations in South and Southeast Asia face significant hurdles in creating and implementing effective data governance frameworks.

The report seeks to uncover the unique challenges faced by countries in the region, including opaque policy-making processes, limited stakeholder participation, and policies that may not always align with local contexts or implementation capacities. It also highlights the critical need for building institutional capacity and creating opportunities for diverse voices to influence policy development. By examining successful models and innovative approaches, we seek to identify pathways for improving data governance regimes.

## Scope of "data governance"

In order to discuss the data governance landscape in South and Southeast Asia, we must first delineate what we mean by the term data. One way of looking at data, perhaps the most commonly used method, which is also preferred by businesses, is to view it as property [@kitchinCriticalDataStudies2014]. It can also be looked at in terms of the social relations it develops, or in terms of how it represents people, and the cultural, political and epistemic value that it generates [@viljoenRelationalTheoryData2021] [@boydCriticalQuestionsBig2012]. In this report, we seek to avoid looking at 'data' as being merely synonymous with 'information', which risks bringing issues such as freedom of expression, censorship, etc., which we hold to be outside the realm of 'data' governance. Rather, the focus of this report is more on information that is or can be made machine-readable, organized in a fashion, turned into datasets and databases, etc.

Most academic works that discuss data governance have an implicit idea of what "data governance" means, which they do not spell out. Even when they spell it out, as the OECD does, it leads to a situation where some focus on data protection, while others focus on cross-border flow of data and issues like data localization [@oecdGoingDigitalGuide2022]. We decided to take a broader view in which data governance refers to diverse arrangements, including technical, policy, regulatory or institutional provisions, that affect data and their creation, collection, storage, use, protection, access, sharing and deletion across policy domains and organizational and national borders.

In this context we look at data governance, a term usually used to refer to management of data within organizations, as governmental regulations, policies and practices around 'data'. This is very different from corporate data governance, since the government does not formulate policies and practices around data management for internal use, but sets the regulations for all entities within that jurisdiction (and sometimes, extra-territorially as well). Due to this definition, we include "right to information" regimes within the scope of our study, but exclude laws relating to censorship, Internet shutdowns, misinformation, etc.

## Importance of data governance

Data is increasingly being recognized as an enabler for development. It is an essential requirement for policy making and monitoring of development goals and targets [@asiandevelopmentbankDataDevelopment2022]. When effectively managed, data can be used as an asset to support significant development actions such as poverty reduction, food security, mitigating impact of climate change, and disaster management. If mismanaged, it can exacerbate inequalities and undermine the development potential of the same actions [@vinuesaRoleArtificialIntelligence2020]. Data governance ecosystems are made up of policies, laws, practices, behaviors, and technologies that govern data. An ideal data governance system would protect rights, enable innovation, improve transparency, and help in bringing about democratic, inclusive governance. Through the rest of the report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term "policies" is used as shorthand for policies, statutes, regulations, rules, administrative orders, and even practices and technologies that are used to implement all of those as part of the data governance ecosystems.

The policies that make up the data governance ecosystem are developed at different points in time, often with an overlap in their coverage, and sometimes even conflict with each other. In developed countries the inherent tensions in policies related to data are usually resolved in the policy making stage or at least through a well-functioning judiciary. However, this may not necessarily be the case in developing countries of South and Southeast Asia.

## Policymaking landscape of South and Southeast Asia

The policymaking process in South and Southeast Asia is often opaque, non-participatory, and non-consultative and the policies themselves may not necessarily be evidence-based being instead influenced by power and political agendas, such as intimidating and discouraging dissent against the ruling dispensation [@IDRCHarnessingDataDemocratic]. Moreover, institutions involved in the data governance ecosystem usually do not have the wherewithal to bring about substantial change. For those outside formal policy-making processes there are very few opportunities to influence policy because participatory processes aren't common. Such circumstances are ideal grounds for germination of the "Brussels Effect," or rather an element of it known as the *de jure* Brussels Effect, i.e., where EU rules are often used as a template by other jurisdictions owing to its overall political influence coupled with its experience, expertise, etc., which makes it easier for other countries to copy and enforce rules that closely copy EU regulations [@bradfordEuropeanUnionGlobalised2021]. Further, the civil law tradition of the EU usually leads to more precise and detailed rules which are easier to emulate, especially in developing countries that may have less-skilled administrative agencies and judiciaries [@bradfordEuropeanUnionGlobalised2021]. This study provides empirical evidence on whether the Brussels Effect exists in South and Southeast Asia in relation to data governance, and how strong it is.

## Objectives and research questions

This synthesis report seeks to present a comprehensive examination of data governance ecosystems in South and Southeast Asia, with a focus on their potential to foster democratic and inclusive governance.

Our research was guided by two primary objectives:

1.  We aimed to provide a detailed analysis of existing and emerging data governance policies, laws, and bills across the region. This analysis sought to illuminate the overall architecture of these systems, highlighting the intersections and tensions among various legal and policy regimes.

2.  Through our investigation, we attempted to identify critical gaps in current data governance ecosystems. Based on this assessment, we proposed a common core of policies that may be essential for developing rights-preserving and innovation-enabling data governance systems.

This report aims to contribute to the ongoing global dialogue on data governance, while strengthening the ability to engage policymakers and other actors through research. We seek to explore how data governance systems might be leveraged to promote democratic and inclusive governance, drawing inspiration from innovative approaches across the region.

Against this context, the broader project addresses the following overarching research questions:

- How can data governance systems contribute to bringing about democratic and inclusive governance for all?

- How can developments in community-led data governance inspire more inclusive data governance policies in the region?

Our focus in this report is to answer the first question. The specific research questions that we've posed are:

1.  What is common, and what is nationally specific, in the emerging data governance architectures in South and Southeast Asia? What are the explanations?

2.  What are the implications of the emergent nature of the governance architecture? Because there is no overall design that envisions how the parts fit together, it is likely that there will be friction points and even contradictions. How are these being worked out?

3.  The emerging governance architecture involves trade-offs among objectives such as greater accountability of powerholders, economic growth including creation of employment and wealth, resilience of systems, etc. How have different societies: (a) explicitly recognized the trade-offs or not; and (b) handled them?

4.  Are there legislative or policy innovations with potential for replication? What are the modalities of sharing experiences? Are developing countries learning from each other, or are they learning from the developed countries?

5.  How were the laws and bills developed? What expertise was brought to bear? How open were the procedures? How receptive were drafters to suggestions and criticisms?

6.  How were capacity challenges addressed: by simplifying the laws or by tolerating incomplete implementation?

By addressing these key issues, this report aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on how data governance can be leveraged as a tool for positive societal change in South and Southeast Asia and beyond. Our findings and recommendations are intended to serve as a resource for policymakers, researchers, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders working towards creating more effective, equitable, and forward-looking data governance frameworks in the region and beyond.

## Structure of the country reports

The D4DAsia project has produced nine reports so far --- seven detailed individual country reports which deal with the issues of data governance in the following countries: India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand; a detailed look at data protection in South Korea; and a synthesis report that summarizes the findings from the various countries while drawing out the contrasts amongst them, along with detailed findings to the research questions we posed.

### Governance background

To provide the necessary background knowledge needed to understand the data governance structures in each country, each report starts by providing contextual information about the constitution and governance framework in the country, including how lawmaking powers are distributed and delegated, the powers of the judiciary to overturn laws or to enforce policies, and the legal and regulatory background in the country.

### Increasing openness / access

The reports then discuss policies (in which we include statutes, executive orders, regulations, etc., as well as unenforceable guidelines) and practices that increase openness or access. By this we mean policies that allow greater access by citizens, consumers, and corporations to data, or facilitate interoperability or cross-border data transfer. Specifically, we do not include increased governmental access to citizens' private data or non-public corporate data.

These sections would discuss open data policies, the question of how much governmental data is made available proactively and how much is reactive as well as the quality of data being disseminated. The reports also assess government policies favoring or requiring free and open source software (FOSS) or open standards, noting any specific standards mentioned.

### Decreasing openness / access

The reports then move on to discuss the opposite, i.e., laws, policies and practices which decrease openness. By this we mean decreasing access of citizens, consumers, and corporations to data. To be clear, this is not a negative value judgement, since upholding important individual and collective rights, such as privacy and security, necessitate reducing access to data.

This theme explores issues of security such as whether there are any data retention or localization requirements, restrictions on the right to access information (such as national security, privacy, etc.) and exceptions to data security requirements for law enforcement. They further discuss the privacy and copyright framework in brief and specifically try to answer whether there are any exceptions for search engines as well as for research and artificial intelligence (AI).

### Deep dives into exemplar policies and areas

The last part of the reports consists of a deep dive examining the policy gaps and frictions in the data governance framework in each country.

This report synthesizes information and analysis from the individual country reports, highlighting key issues in each country and broader regional trends.

# Overview of data governance policies in South and South-East Asia

The issue of data governance and the policies surrounding its implementation is a critical one for governments, citizens, and businesses across the world. As mentioned earlier, we use the term data governance to refer to "diverse arrangements, including technical, policy, regulatory or institutional provisions, that affect data and their creation, collection, storage, use, protection, access, sharing and deletion across policy domains and organizational and national borders" [@oecdGoingDigitalGuide2022].

## Increasing openness / access

The analysis in this section covers three main aspects of 'openness': the legal background for the right to information and data collection laws; the state of open data initiatives in each country; and the policies in place to promote the technical openness --- open standards and free/open-source software --- that underpins other forms of openness in a digital environment.

The first part looks at the constitutional provisions and statutory laws that enshrine the right to information and mandate the collection of data like census and statistics in the countries studied. The second part examines how the open data policies are being implemented in practice in these nations, including the existence of open data portals, the quality of data being disseminated, and the challenges faced in proactive disclosure. The last part explores software and standard policies, specifically looking at whether governments have policies favoring free/open source software (FOSS) and the adoption of open standards for software interoperability and data exchange across government systems. The chapter ends with an overview, highlighting the progress made as well as the gaps and areas for improvement.

### Right to information

**Does the right to information have constitutional status? Is there an RTI Act? What is the scope of the RTI Act? Is proactive disclosure mandated or only reactive disclosure? Are there exceptions?**

##### Findings

All of the countries studied have specific laws that provide for the right of the public to access information held by the State. The laws all seem to follow the maxim "disclosure is the norm, secrecy is the exception." However, they vary on how extensive their coverage is, whether they are provided for by executive orders or statutory law, and the forms of exceptions that they have.

The right to access public information has been constitutionally recognized in all the seven jurisdictions studied. Similarly, all of them also have RTI regimes that provide for both proactive as well as reactive disclosure requirements. The RTI regimes of all the jurisdictions also provide for exceptions to the data that may be revealed, the most common of which are national security, personal data, and economic security, along with less common ones such as trade secrets/intellectual property, fiduciary relationship, etc. Some countries, like Indonesia, explicitly place "public interest" ahead of the specific exceptions to the right to information.

In the global RTI rating index by the Centre for Law and Democracy which assesses the legal frameworks of countries for accessing information held by the government, Sri Lanka has the best score (131) followed closely by India (126), Nepal (112) and Pakistan (108), Indonesia (100) with Thailand (75) and Philippines (47) lagging considerably behind [@centreforlawanddemocracyGlobalRightInformation2023]

##### India

While the Indian constitution doesn't explicitly speak of the right to information, Article 19(1)(a) --- the provision that guarantees freedom of expression to all citizens --- has been read by the Indian Supreme Court to include the right to information. The Right to Information Act, 2005 was passed after long years of grassroots activism by dozens of organizations. The law provides for both proactive and reactive disclosure. Amongst the proactive disclosures required is a list of the information maintained by each department of the government. Intelligence agencies are exempted from the applicability of the RTI Act. The Act contains a list of exemptions such as sovereignty, security, scientific or economic interests of the country, parliamentary privilege, trade secrets and intellectual property, fiduciary liability, personal information, etc. There is however a public interest override for disclosure of personal information as well as trade secrets and intellectual property rights.

##### Indonesia

The right to access public information has constitutional recognition in Indonesia. Article 28-F of the Indonesian Constitution provides that every person is entitled to communicate and obtain information for the development of his/her personality and social environment, as well as be entitled to seek, obtain, own, store, process, and convey information through all kinds of available channels. In addition, Article 28-J paragraph (2) also mandates that in the exercise of his/her rights and freedom every person shall abide by the limitations to be stipulated by the laws to solely guarantee the recognition as well as respect for the rights and freedoms of the others and to comply with just demands following considerations for morality, religious values, security, and public order in a democratic society.

In line with the Constitution, Law No 40 of 1999 also recognizes the press' right to information. The right of the public to access public information is statutorily manifested through Law 14 of 2008 on Disclosure of Public Information as Right to Information, which has both proactive as well as reactive disclosure requirements. However, there are exceptions to the types of information that can be disclosed, such as law enforcement, intellectual property, defense and state security, natural wealth, economic security, diplomatic relations, personal secrets, etc. All exemptions, except for \"natural wealth\" in Indonesia, are subject to a harm test. Institutions are mandated to explain exemptions restrictively, and information may not be restricted permanently. Additionally, a mandatory public interest override applies to all exemptions, allowing the release of protected information if it serves a larger interest [@PublicInformationDisclosure2008].

##### Nepal

The right to privacy and right to information is enshrined under the Constitution of Nepal as a fundamental right of every person. The Right to Information Act, 2064 (2007) was promulgated to make state actions more open and transparent. Therefore, it has provisions for both reactive and proactive disclosure of information. Although digitization of the records is a challenge for proactive disclosure of information, the information provided by the agencies is generally accurate. It also provides for exemptions such as national security, sovereignty of the nation and matters which have severe effect on commercial and banking interest. Furthermore, the representative of the National Information Commission informed the authors that information that could potentially incite unrest or conflict among groups or citizens is kept confidential until the situation stabilizes.

##### Pakistan

As per Article 19A, every citizen of Pakistan has a right to access information of public importance, subject to reasonable restrictions. In line with the Article 19A of the Constitution, the Right to Access of Information Act, 2017 (RTI) was enacted in 2017 to prescribe the process of making requests for information, providing such information by the government entities, and appointing point of contact in every public entity. According to Section 5, all public bodies are obliged to proactively disclose all the stated information including description of the public body and policies and laws, on the website of that public body. Under the RTI, the Government has also appointed the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) to address complaints about denial, refusal or non-provision of requested information or providing false / incomplete information.

##### Philippines

Section 7, Article III of the Philippines Constitution guarantees the right of the people to information on matters of public concern. Section 28, Article II also declares as state policy the adoption and implementation of a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest. However, unlike Article III, Section 7, Section 28 falls within the general declarations of state policies which are generally not enforceable through the courts. No law has been passed by the Congress to statutorily implement the constitutional right to access ostensibly guaranteed by the Constitutional provisions. However, in 2016, an Executive Order ("FOI Ordinance") was issued by the President of the Philippines (exercising his power as the administrative head of the executive), which established an administrative procedure within the executive branch of government for reviewing and granting requests for access to government records and documents [@InstitutionalizingPhilippineOpen2023]. Although the FOI Ordinance was silent as to the utilization of the Internet in dealing with requests for information (and indeed refers to an offline process), the government by November 2016 had launched an online portal through which such requests could be submitted and documents released [@ranadaDuterteGovtLaunches2016].

##### Sri Lanka

The right to information is guaranteed as a fundamental right by Article 14A of the Constitution of Sri Lanka [@ConstitutionSL2023]. Statutorily manifesting this right, the Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 ("RTI Act") was passed on 4^th^ August 2016 and operationalized on 3 February 2017 [@RightInformationAct2016]. The RTI Act provides for both proactive and reactive disclosure. It imposes a duty on the Minister to publish a report in electronic form in relation to the functioning of the Ministry, budget, operations, and so on [@RightInformationAct2016].[^1] It also requires Ministries to make all details that are relevant to any new projects publicly accessible three months prior to the commencement of a project [@RightInformationAct2016].[^2] Regulation 20 issued under the RTI Act for proactive disclosure requires all public authorities[^3] to submit, at the very minimum, information in relation to the institution, operation, budget, and other essential details [@RegulationsPromulgatedRight2017]. There are several exemptions given in section 5(1) of the Act which would prevent the disclosure of information such as personal information, national security, prejudicial to the economy, trade secrets, medical records, professional confidence, fiduciary relationship, parliamentary privilege, etc.

##### Thailand

Section 58 of the Thai Constitution B.E.2540 (1997) was the first provision that explicitly guaranteed that the public has a right to access to public information in possession of governmental agencies, which they could use to exercise their political rights effectively. Currently, the right to access to public information in the possession of government agencies is now guaranteed by Section 41 of the Thai Constitution B.E.2560 (2017). The Official Information Act B.E.2540 (1997), was the first law addressing the concept of access to information and follows the principle that "disclosure is the principle; secrecy is the exception." This law also has proactive and reactive disclosure requirements, but only about 10 percent of government-held public information is proactively disclosed, with the remaining 90 percent disclosed only upon request. The grounds of exception include national security, public order and safety, the rights and reputation of others and personal data. Further all government agencies and public officers have to ensure that the majority of information should be publicly available, and information that falls within the scope of the exceptions should comprise a small portion.

### Statistics and Census

##### Findings

Similar to the right to information, all jurisdictions have a statutory requirement for collection of statistical data to help with various development activities of the government. The mandate of such statutes is usually implemented through a dedicated office or authority which is also responsible for making the data accessible to the public. Further, in the cases of India, the Philippines and Thailand, other government agencies and departments are also mandated to cooperate with this agency in order to collect and maintain the data and databases.

+===================================+==================================================+

##### India

India\'s statistical framework is governed by several key laws, each addressing different aspects of data collection and privacy. The Census Act 1948 mandates the decennial census, requiring comprehensive demographic, social, and economic data collection while ensuring confidentiality. The Collection of Statistics Act, initially passed in 1953 and replaced in 2008, expanded the scope of data gathering from primarily industrial and commercial statistics to include economic, demographic, social, scientific, and environmental information. This Act applies to various entities and emphasizes both mandatory reporting and data privacy protection.

Additionally, the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 establishes a uniform system for recording vital events, contributing to the nation\'s statistical foundation. Collectively, these laws strive to balance the need for accurate, comprehensive data essential for governance with the protection of individual privacy, adapting to India\'s evolving socio-economic landscape.

##### Indonesia

As per Law No. 16 of 1997 statistics are collected by the Centre of Indonesian Statistics (BPS) which follows data such as census, survey, the compilation of administrative products and other methods in keeping with developments in science and technology [@Statistics1997].[^4] Censuses are to be conducted at least once every ten years and consist of: (i) a population census; (ii) an agricultural census; and (iii) an economic census [@Statistics1997].[^5] Compilation of administrative products is owned by government institutions but is available for public utilization unless prevailing legislation specifies otherwise. Every individual has an equal opportunity to access the compilation of administrative products owned by a non-government institution, an organization, an individual, or another part of the community but must maintain regard for the legally protected rights of an individual or an institution [@Statistics1997].[^6] BPS may publish the statistics it has collected in the Official Statistics News [@Statistics1997].[^7] All data from BPS is available at [[bps.go.id]{.underline}](https://www.bps.go.id/id) or directly at BPS' national, provincial and local offices.

##### Nepal

The Statistical Act, 2079 (2022) (the \"Statistics Act\") defines various terms related to data and its protection. The main purpose of the Statistics Act is to assist the Federal, provincial and local governments in efficient public service by ensuring the production, processing, collection, publication and distribution of statistics is organized and reliable. The Statistics Act sets out the standard for demographic indicators. It also creates a repository for the data collected. It also states that provincial or local governments may collect, process, analyze, publish, distribute or store the statistical data [@StatisticsAct2022]. The information processed and collected pursuant to the Statistics Act is published on the website of the National Statistical Office.

##### Pakistan

The Industrial Statistics Act, 1942 and The General Statistics (Re-organization) Act, 2011 deal with census and collection of statistical data in Pakistan. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics supplies aggregate level data to users free of charge; however, special tabulation can be provided on demand for a prescribed charge. Supply of sensitive data requires prior approval of the Federal Statistics Authority i.e. Secretary, Statistics Division.

##### Philippines

The Republic Act No. 10625 established the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) which is the highest policy-making body on statistical matters, with its data the official and controlling statistics of the government [@PhilippineStatisticalAct2013]. The PSA is particularly required to collect, compile, analyze, abstract and publish statistical information relating to the country's economic, social, demographic, political affairs and general activities and condition of the people. The PSA is required further to collaborate with departments of the national government in the collection, compilation, maintenance and publication of statistical information, including special statistical data derived from the activities of those departments, corporations and their subsidiaries.

##### Sri Lanka

The Census Ordinance of 1900 has substantially remained the basis for census taking in Sri Lanka throughout the years, with amendments in 1945, 1955, 1980 and 2000. Currently this does not appear to have provisions relating to digitization of data etc. but efforts are on to bring about amendments as required. The data dissemination section of the Department of Census and Statistics ("DCS") provides access to the official statistical publications and datasets available on its main website electronically and from the Departmental sales counter for printed publications [@DepartmentCensusStatisticsb] [@LankaDatta]. Further, data users with advanced statistical requirements can make a request to the DCS [@DepartmentCensusStatistics].

##### Thailand

Section 6 of the Statistics Act B.E. 2550 (2007) imposes the responsibility on the National Statistical Office of Thailand (NSOT) to prepare, collect and create statistics [@nationalstatisticalofficeNSO] [@StatisticsActBE25502007]. The NSOT has a significant role in maintaining and operating databases and accessibility to public information and all government agencies are required to cooperate with the NSOT [@opendevelopmentthailandPersonalDataProtection2021] [^8] to create catalogues of government data focusing on statistics and directory services [@nationalstatisticalofficeIntroductionGovernmentData2020].

### Other proactive disclosure of information

##### Findings

All the countries studied have a national archive which is maintained according to a statutory framework and a specific authority is responsible for the collection and maintenance of the materials as well as for allowing access to the same to individuals. Other than archiving legislation there are other legislations which also allow for dissemination of information to the public such as the property registry and certain civil records which are openly accessible to the public in Philippines, while environmental data is mandated to be disclosed by the Indonesian Environmental Protection and Management Act, Law No. 32/2009.

+===================================+========================================================================================+

##### 

##### India

The Public Records Act, 1993 and the Companies Act, 2013 both contain provisions for proactive disclosure of information. The Public Records Act requires government bodies to maintain and preserve records, making them accessible to the public after 30 years, unless exempted for specific reasons. The Companies Act mandates that companies disclose various financial and operational details in their annual reports and through filings with the Registrar of Companies, which are then made publicly available.

The CSIR Open Access Mandate of 2011 and the Policy on Open APIs for Government of India (2015) focus on increasing access to scientific and governmental data respectively. The CSIR mandate requires all CSIR laboratories to submit their research papers to an open access repository, making publicly-funded research freely available. The Open APIs policy encourages government departments to proactively release their APIs, allowing easier integration and use of government data by third parties.

The 2021 Guidelines under the National Map Policy, 2005 have liberalized the rules around mapping, allowing private companies to collect, generate, and distribute geospatial data without prior approval, though some restrictions remain for sensitive areas. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, while not a law, is a proactive initiative to document and digitize India\'s traditional knowledge, making it freely accessible to patent examiners worldwide to prevent misappropriation.

##### Indonesia

Among other laws, Law No. 40 of 1999 not only recognizes the press\'s right to information but also emphasizes the public\'s entitlement to seek, acquire, and disseminate ideas and information [@PressLawNo401999]. Additionally, the Environmental Protection and Management Act, Law No. 32/2009 also compels governments to establish environmental information systems for publishing crucial data, such as environmental status, vulnerability maps, and other pertinent information. Indonesia also has an Archives Act that provides for the preservation of records but there are no rules governing a systematic declassification of documents. Material prior to Indonesian Independence can be found at the National Archives [@IndonesiaArchivesUS].

##### Nepal

The Archives Preservation Act, 2046 (1986) was enacted on May 28, 2008 and provides for the establishment of a national archives responsible for maintaining records in a systematic and secure manner [@ArchivesPreservationAct1986].[^9] Individuals are granted access to non-prohibited records upon application to the National Archives in the prescribed format and payment of applicable fees [@ArchivesPreservationRule2007].[^10] A brief overview of the Archives Act indicates that it comes under reactive disclosure as information is disclosed only after a request is made to view any record. It also actively excludes the disclosure of 'prohibited records' which are defined in a precise manner and could include any document which is marked as prohibited by the National Archives or is prohibited from a national perspective.

##### Pakistan

The National Archives Act, 1993 deals with issues related to the national archives of Pakistan. The National Archives of Pakistan (NAP) is a body established by the Government of Pakistan for the purpose of preserving and making available public and private records, which have bearings on the history, culture and heritage of Pakistan. Some of the stated functions of NAP are the acquisition, preservation, conservation, reprography, restoration, automation, dissemination and access of documents.

##### Philippines

There are a number of different statutes and administrative rules that enable access by the public to certain types of publicly-held data, as well as certain privately-held data, owing to public interest or pursuant to any public purpose. Examples of such laws include the 1930 Law on Registry of Civil Status (Act No. 3753) (which records civil status of persons, including births, deaths, marriages, and changes of name, etc.) [@LawRegistryCivil1930], the Republic Act No. 11909 (which mandates developing a civil registry database and virtual viewing facility that would allow the easier verification of the authenticity of such civil registry records) [@PermanentValidityCertificates2022], the 1979 Property Registration Decree (which mandates the registration of certificates of title confirming land ownership) [@PropertyRegistrationDecree1978], the Republic Act 9470 (which establishes the National Archives of the Philippines, the official repository of public records and archives where they are preserved, conserved and made available to the public) [@NationalArchivesPhilippines2007], etc.

##### Sri Lanka

The National Archives Law No. 48 of 1973 provides for the establishment of the Department of National Archives, for the transfer of public records to the archives and lays down provisions for the custody and preservation of public records. Section 16 of the Act sets out that the Minister has the power to make regulations allowing for public access to public archives and terms and conditions. The Minister also has the power to prohibit or restrict disclosure of information [@NationalArchivesLaw1973].[^11] Gazette Regulations for this were issued in 1979 and amended in 1980 [@PublicAccessGovernment1980]. According to information on the National Archives, these are the most recently issued regulations.

The lack of proper systems for providing digital access to information and ensuring digital records management has been identified as a gap in the existing archiving regulations. The draft National Policy on Archives and Records Management describes this as one of the priority issues that need to be addressed and the Policy gives detailed recommendations on addressing it, including revising the existing Archives Act [@DraftNationalPolicyArchives2023].[^12] The policy also notes that in June 2023, the Sri Lanka National Archives became a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Archives (UDA), which states that the global community of archives and archivists undertake to collaborate so that "Archives are made accessible to everyone\...".

A Committee has been appointed to revise the existing National Archives Law. A Framework for National Archives and Records Management Legislation was released in January 2024, by the Committee [@FrameworkNationalArchives2024]. Part III contains suggested regulations regarding increasing public access to records and setting up systems for management of records.

##### Thailand

The Official Information Act 1997 is the primary legislation that not only addresses the issue of data openness but also requires government departments and agencies to disclose information and data in their possession to the public (subject to exceptions outlined in the Act and other laws). Regarding information about companies that will be listed in the stock market, Section 24/1 of the Securities and Exchange Act B.E. 2535 (1992) assigns the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission the duty to disclose to the public information about the issuance or offering for sale of securities, the companies issuing or offering these securities, securities companies, the Securities Exchange, over-the-counter centers, and so on.

### Open data

Open data refers to data that's openly accessible, in a machine-readable form, using an open format, and provided under an open license that allows everyone to reuse the data without any permissions for any purpose.

In a global open data index that ranks countries based on both coverage and on openness, the countries are ranked in the following order: Indonesia (26), Philippines (36), India (82), Sri Lanka (96), Thailand (99), Nepal (117), and Pakistan (121) [@opendatawatchOpenDataInventory2023].

In order to explore the open data framework in the jurisdictions studied we asked certain questions, the answers to which would ideally give us a better understanding of the open data regime in each country.

#### Open data policies

**1. Does any legislation or policy require open data? Are there any websites which proactively make data available? If there's an open data portal, how** **effective is it?**

+===================================+==================================================================================+

Of the countries studied, only Indonesia and Philippines are members of the Open Government Partnership. Still, all countries with the exception of Nepal have a single website ("open data portal") with the aim of providing access to government data. Nepal whilst not having a one stop portal for data dissemination ensures that the website of each government entity publishes the related information on their website such as the Credit Information Bureau of Nepal, Office of Company Registrar, Department of Land Management and Archives, etc. Pakistan's open government data portal is run by a private entity and not the government. It must also be pointed out that some countries such as Indonesia, India, Thailand, the Philippines, etc. despite having a single website for government data, also follow the practice of various departments putting out data, especially budget-related data, on their websites for access by the public.

##### India

The Indian government\'s approach to open data has evolved significantly since the publication of the first report on open government data in India in 2010 [@wrightOpenGovernmentData2010]. Following early research and discussions about joining the Open Government Partnership, which India eventually didn't, India launched its National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) in 2012, which saw the Right to Information Act as its basis [@deyIndiaOpenGovernment2013] [@departmentofscienceandtechnologyNationalDataSharing2012]. This policy encourages the sharing of non-sensitive, publicly funded data from various government entities. To implement this policy, the government introduced the data.gov.in portal as a centralized platform for accessing government datasets [@ministryofelectronicsandinformationtechnologyOpenGovernmentData2022]. While the portal has published numerous resources and received significant traffic, it has faced challenges such as inconsistent data quality, outdated information, and gaps in critical datasets [@agarwalIndiaMustMore2015]. The government has continued to refine its approach, introducing implementation guidelines in 2015, and publishing the \"Government Open Data License -- India\" in 2017 to govern the use of released data [@ogddivisionnicImplementationGuidelinesNDSAP2015] [@GovernmentOpenData].

In parallel with these national efforts, several Indian states and cities have developed their own open data policies. These include initiatives in Sikkim, Odisha, Telangana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu [@panjiarComparisonStatelevelData2022]. These policies aim to promote transparency, increase citizen engagement, and improve decision-making at more localized levels. However, the effectiveness of both national and state-level open data initiatives has been mixed, with inconsistent implementation across different government agencies. While there are signs of improvement, a comprehensive evaluation of these policies\' impact remains to be conducted.

##### Indonesia

The Indonesian government has been actively advancing big data transformation in governance, as mandated by Article 31 of Law Number 25 of 2004 on the National Development Planning System. This emphasizes the importance of accurate and transparent data in the development planning process. To make transparency manifested for the public to access, the government has developed e-services that frequently proved unpopular, unsustainable, or fragmented [@unitednationsGearingEgovernmentSupport2018]. However, a substantial transformation in e-government practices transpired before 2018, characterized by the inception of unified data and services. The initial steps toward achieving data-driven digital service delivery in Indonesia involve utilizing the guiding principles outlined in the E-Government Presidential Regulation No. 95 of 2018. Open Data Indonesia is accessible at [[data.go.id]{.underline}](http://data.go.id) for the national open data platform. Local government has managed open data, in the provinces access platforms are accessible in their provincial platform such as opendata.jabarprov.go.id for the West Java Province and satudata.jakarta.go.id for the Jakarta Province. In addition, city/regency open data platforms also exist which are managed by local government such as Bandung City opendata.bandung.go.id, and Surabaya City opendata.surabaya.go.id. Moreover, open data is also shared on the BPS website as mentioned previously.

##### Nepal

Although there is no integrated website for the publication or access of all government data, the website of each government entity publishes the related information in their website which makes information accessible to the general public such as the Credit Information Bureau of Nepal, Office of Company Registrar, Department of Land Management and Archives, etc. Information processed and collected pursuant to the Statistics Act is published on the website of the National Statistical Office [@nationalstatisticsofficeCensusNepal2021]. The Supreme Court of Nepal also publishes case laws on its website [@SupremeCourtNepal], and the Ministry of Finance publishes the budget for every fiscal year including the Expenditure Details (the Red Book) [@ministryoffinanceFiscalBudget2023]. Provincial and local governments also publish their budgets, which can be publicly accessed through the website of the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration [@mofagaLocalBudget].

##### Pakistan

Under Section 5 of the RTI Act, every public body is obliged to proactively make certain data available on the websites of these public bodies. In addition to that, Pakistan being part of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), established an open data portal (https://opendata.com.pk/), containing databases of various sectors. This Open Data Pakistan portal is managed by the National Center for Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and Higher Education Commission (HEC).

##### Philippines

The Open Data Portal (data.gov.ph) serves as a central platform for various government agencies to publish open datasets and receives contributions from seventeen (17) government departments and agencies. Further the Philippine Statistics Authority which was established in 2013 through Republic Act No. 10625 [@PhilippineStatisticalAct2013] and is primarily responsible for all national censuses and surveys, runs OpenSTAT (openstat.psa.gov.ph) for accessing official statistical data. Other government websites like dbm.gov.ph, fdpp.dilg.gov.ph, and asti.dost.gov.ph/coare/datasets*,* provide access to budget and local government data.

##### Sri Lanka

The Dissemination Policy on Microdata, Department of Census and Statistics [@deptofcensusandstatisticssrilankaDataDissaPolicy2007] of 2014 sets out the guidelines that the Department of Census and Statistics should follow in publishing and disseminating statistical data to all users, to support policy formulation and decision making. The policy sets out procedures which members of the public can use to apply for release of data from the Survey Department. However, the policy does not appear to have been updated since 2014. The policy lists a website, data.gov.lk, where metadata can be provided to the public.

##### Thailand

In 2015, the Thai government initiated its Open Government Data project by commissioning the EGA to compile a list of types of public information that needed to be disclosed and then ordering all government agencies to provide the required public information on the list for uploading to data.go.th [@thaipublicaPrayutOrderedElectronic2015]. This one-stop information website contains information pertinent to, for example, culture, law and justice, education, economy and finance, public health, official statistics, agriculture, social welfare, transportation and logistics, politics, sciences and technology and local and regional affairs. It is still extremely active today. There have been 3,878,375 users and 14,920,495 visits as of October 9, 2023 [@thaipublicaPrayutOrderedElectronic2015]. Additionally, the Census Office provides data on its own website. The statistics in the form of data catalogs are uploaded to and made publicly available on catalog.nso.go.th. For scholarly literature, the ThaiLIS Digital Collection (TCD) serves as a repository of dissertations, theses and research reports from several colleges and universities nationwide [@ThaiLISDigitalCollection]. Thailand also has an academic journal database, Thai Journals Online (ThaiJO). It is supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI), an agency under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, as well as Thai-Journal Citation Index Center and leading Thai universities [@thaijournalonlineThaiJo21]. With regard to geoinformatics, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is the main government agency responsible for making this information available, which can be accessed via data.go.th [@digitalgovernmentdevelopmentagencyGeographicInformationServices2015]. According to the Cabinet resolution on April 24, 2011, all information covered by Sections 7[^13] and 9[^14] of the Official Information Act B.E.2540 (1997) must be made publicly available on the websites of all government agencies [@OfficialInformationAct1997] [@ministryofinteriorReportImplementation2012].

#### Open data in practice

**2. What is the general status of implementation of these laws and policies in the country including quality of data being disseminated?**

Although the principle of access to public data has some sort of statutory or executive recognition in every country --- Thailand even has a Data Quality Assessment Framework which provides tools to assess the quality of the public information disclosed --- however the implementation of the principle of open data leaves a lot to be desired in every country. Public authorities in all the countries studied have fallen short of their obligation to proactively disclose the data due to various reasons ranging from inefficient information management systems in Indonesia, to inefficient linkages with the statistics authority in the Philippines, to lack of technical personnel in Nepal.

##### India

While there is a functional national open data portal (data.gov.in), it suffers from a number of deficiencies, including outdated data sets. However, private and non-profit entities have often stepped in to fill in the gaps by launching portals like Open Budgets India [@Openbudgetsindiaorg].

##### Indonesia

[According to the Cabinet resolution on 24^th^ April 2011, all information covered by Sections 7]{.mark}[^15] [and 9]{.mark}[^16] [of the Official Information Act B.E.2540 (1997) must be made publicly available on the websites of all government agencies]{.mark}.[^17] However, reports on implementation reveal that, in practice, public authorities often fail to regularly publish information as required by RTI legislation. Despite progressive provisions regarding proactive disclosure in Indonesia, a study indicated that information is not adequately available proactively. This deficiency is largely attributed to inefficient information management systems and a shortage of capacities and skills within public bodies.

##### Nepal

The National Statistical Office website seems to have missing data, and data retrieval is challenging. Not all required information is readily accessible to the National Statistical Office and the published data on the website is the summarized version of a larger set of micro-data. This limitation is attributed to a shortage of technical personnel and insufficient coordination among various ministries, resulting in the absence of crucial data, notably pertaining to the banking and financial sectors.

##### Pakistan

Pakistan has right to information as a fundamental right in its Constitution and has RTI and other laws to support that fundamental right. A regulatory body in the shape of Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) has been created to enforce the RTI law. Although the country has not yet reached the optimal level of accountability and transparency, applicants do get most of the requested information through the RTI Act, the General Statistics (Re-organization) Act and the National Archives Act. If the requested information is not provided by the public body, a right of appeal has been given to the dissatisfied applicant and the appellate forum, the PIC must decide the appeal within 60 days. PIC decisions are available on its website. Further, under Section 22 of the RTI Act, willful obstruction or destruction of record is a crime. The RTI Act also has an overriding effect on all other laws. However, in practice, the Official Secrets Act is given more importance in government offices, than the RTI Act, when it comes to refusing information requests.

##### Philippines

A review of the Philippine Statistics Authority's OpenStat platform reveals that the included datasets are more comprehensive and more substantive than those that are available on the Open Data website. Owing to the agency's statutory mandate that requires it to focus on data gathering and analysis, it is not surprising that the management of the OpenStat platform is more professional as compared to the Open Data Portal. The Open Data Portal unfortunately has proven thus far unable to take advantage or make any meaningful linkages to the PSA database.

##### Sri Lanka

Studies indicate that proactive disclosure levels are dismal in the country. The RTI regime in Sri Lanka primarily relies on reactive disclosures. A study conducted by a think-tank revealed that over 70% of public authorities (only Ministries) had disclosed online less than 40% of the information they were required to by the RTI Act [@veriteresearchProactiveDisclosureRTI2023]. This shows the low level of compliance amongst public authorities; even the offices of the President and Prime Minister had disclosed less than 20% of required information and ranked among the least compliant -- the Ministry of Technology scoring lowest overall [@veriteresearchProactiveDisclosureRTI2023]. The study also highlighted a very high language bias across most public authorities. Only the Office of the President and Ministry of Wildlife consistently published information online in all three languages, i.e. English, Sinhala and Tamil. Overall, across all public authorities, nearly half of all information online was disclosed in English, but only 37% was disclosed in Sinhala and just 29% in Tamil [@veriteresearchProactiveDisclosureRTI2023]. The majority of the public authorities had failed to submit annual reports although they are statutorily required [@veriteresearchProactiveDisclosureRTI2023].

##### Thailand

In 2023 the Digital Government Development Committee issued an Announcement on Data Quality Assessment Framework for Government Agencies 2023 [@ruangchaweeAnnouncementDigitalGovernment2023]. Its handbook aims to provide a framework and tools for assessing the quality of public information in relation to data management, monitoring and control. Its main purpose is to provide users of public information with the assurance that the data is accurate, reliable and of sufficient quality to be utilized for precise policy and operational decision-making, as well as accurate analysis.

While Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines do not have any specific government policy preferring open software and standards, there were some legislations proposed in the Philippines in the past requiring adoption of FOSS by the government, though no such bills are being deliberated upon currently. India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan do have certain policies on FOSS, though they are unevenly implemented. Nepal in fact has two policies that talk about using open source software, the first being the Digital Nepal Framework, 2019, which provides for the use of open-source software as being more affordable and cost effective. The other policy is the Nepal E-Government Interoperability framework (the "NeGIF") which recommends open-source software and provides for a comprehensive plan and detailed standards with the best practices for the implementation of open source and open standard for interoperability within the government of Nepal but has still not been implemented. The Sri Lanka FOSS Adoption (Draft) mentions that use of FOSS has been the practice. Although Pakistan does not have a specific program on FOSS, it does encourage the use of open source operating systems and office software under the IT Policy and Action Plan, 2000.

##### India

India has implemented various policies to promote Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FOSS) at both national and state levels. At the national level, initiatives began as early as 2004 with the National Informatics Centre sharing the government\'s FOSS experiences [@loneyIndiaSharesOpensource2004]. The establishment of the National Resource Centre for Free & Open Source Software (NRCFOSS) in 2005 marked a significant step, focusing on developing FOSS capacity, including the BOSS Linux operating system [@MajorFOSSInitiatives2021] [@CDACFreeOpen2018]. The National Policy on Information Technology (2012), followed by the Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software for Government of India (2014) and the Policy on Collaborative Application Development (2015), further solidified the government\'s commitment to FOSS adoption in e-Governance systems [@NationalPolicyInformation2012] [@departmentofelectronics&informationtechnologyPolicyCollaborativeApplication2015].

At the state level, Kerala has been a pioneer in FOSS adoption, particularly in education [@krishnaswamyFreeOpenSource2012]. Other states like Assam have also formulated policies promoting FOSS use in government departments and educational institutions [@AssamITPolicy2009]. While these policies aim to encourage FOSS adoption in the public sector, they are not legally enforceable. In the private sector, there are no mandates for FOSS usage, but organizations like the Free Software Movement of India, Swecha, IT for Change, and FOSS United advocate for broader FOSS adoption across various sectors. Despite these efforts, the effectiveness of some policies, such as the collaborative code hosting platform OpenForge, has been limited.

##### Indonesia

Indonesia Go Open Source (IGOS) is a movement to increase the use and development of open source software in Indonesia, which was initiated on June 30, 2004, by five related ministries. The action steps following the declaration are: to use legal software in every government agency; to disseminate the utilization of Open Source Software in Indonesia; to prepare guidelines in the development and utilization of Open Source Software in Indonesia; to encourage the establishment of training centers, competency centers and open source-based business incubator centers in Indonesia, and to encourage and improve coordination, ability, creativity, willingness and participation among the government and society in the maximum utilization of Open Source Software.

##### Nepal

With the aim of increasing openness and encouraging the use of open software, the Digital Nepal Framework, 2019 (the "Digital Framework") has identified key sectors crucial for fostering socioeconomic advancement within Nepal's digital landscape. It also provides for the use of open-source software which can be more affordable and cost effective. This framework was influenced by India's Digital India program. The Digital Framework provides that special benefits will be offered to the local information and communication technology industry to support its growth into a globally competitive software sector. This is to be achieved by encouraging the adoption of both proprietary and open-source solutions for serving both domestic and international markets. Additionally, the Nepal E-Government Interoperability Framework (the "NeGIF") highly recommends and encourages the use of open standards and open-source software for better interoperability to achieve the goal of better governance, providing faster services and reducing redundancy of information [@NepalEGovernmentInteroperability2011]. However, the NeGIF could not be implemented till now despite it being published in 2011.

##### Pakistan

Pakistan does not have a specific program on FOSS; however, it did encourage the use of open source operating systems and office software under the IT Policy and Action Plan 2000. Later, under the Digital Pakistan Policy, it took a step further to enhance skills and capabilities within the government to evaluate open source ICT products and services and encourage R&D of "Open Source" across the country through appropriate means.

##### Philippines

There is no prescribed official policy requiring FOSS to be preferred by the government. There have been proposed legislation in the past filed with the Congress that seeks to require the use and adoption of FOSS by the Government, but no such bills are being deliberated upon by the current Congress. The proposed blueprint for a harmonized government information system developed under the previous Duterte administration known as the E-Government Masterplan acknowledged that underlying the framework for "e-Government systems and applications" includes "encouraging an open source software development framework"; however, this has not been translated into definite rules or policy issuances issued under the current administration.

##### Sri Lanka

The Sri Lanka FOSS Adoption (Draft) states that most of the government's projects have been developed using FOSS [@SriLankaGovernmentFOSSAdoption]. It mentions that using free and open source software has been the practice but does not mention anything of preferring FOSS for projects. It can, however, be gathered that FOSS has been the preference.

##### Thailand

Although the Open Source Education and Development Association (OSEDA) aims to promote the studies and development of open source software, it is limited to the private sector, and the Thai government does not give enough importance to the development of open source software at the moment [@sipaTechnology2016].

### Open standards

\"When it comes to economic, social and cultural rights (ESCRs) in an information society, free software and open standards are both particularly significant\" [@abrahamFreeOpenSource2016]. In terms of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, by promoting open access to software and information, free and open source software (FOSS) and open standards further Article 13\'s call for equal access to education. FOSS\'s royalty-free nature also fulfills Article 15(1)(b)\'s aim of cultural participation for all by enabling access regardless of financial means. Wide adoption of FOSS and open standards by governments enables the right to work under Article 6, as workers can gain transferable digital skills and apply them using freely available tools. Overall, FOSS and open standards are critical for realizing the ICESCR\'s vision of equitable access to education, technology, culture, and work opportunities for all [@abrahamFreeOpenSource2016].

**Is there a policy that requires open standards to be preferred by the Government or requires specific open standards to be used by the Government?**

While Indonesia has issued Presidential Regulation No. 95/2018 on Electronic-Based Government System (SPBE), the Philippines ICT Office has issued circulars to implement specifications that comply with open standards but does not specify any open standards. Sri Lanka has a policy which specifies a set of open standards, but the policy is only in the draft stage. Nepal has two policies which recommend adoption of open standards, one was issued only in 2023 so it is too early to comment upon its effect, but the other which was issued in 2011 and even provides for a comprehensive plan and detailed standards with best practices, has still not been implemented. Only Thailand has an existing policy which is a handbook which specifies WCAG 2.0 as a specific standard for government websites.

#### 2.1.6.1 India

The Indian government has taken several steps to promote open standards in both public and private sectors. In 2010, India adopted a national policy on open standards for e-governance, although its implementation has been limited, despite various e-Gov standards having been notified [@hariharanOpenStandardsPolicy2010] [@departmentofinformationtechnologyPolicyOpenStandards2010]. The government has also introduced Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW), which adopt the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for governmental websites and apps [@nationalinformaticscentreGuidelinesIndianGovernment2023]. A 2012 analysis had already revealed that many government websites were not fully compliant with these guidelines, referring to the 2009 version of the Guidelines [@narasimhanAccessibilityGovernmentWebsites2012]. The concept of \"Digital Public Infrastructure\" has been promoted by the government, emphasizing interoperability and open standards [@SummaryUnionBudget2023].

In the private sector, some open standards are mandated, such as the XBRL standard for financial reporting in the MCA21 project. Organizations like the Indian Software Product Industry RoundTable (iSPIRT) have advocated for open standards as part of the \"India Stack\", potentially influencing private sector adoption [@matthanIndiasApproachData2022]. The government has also launched the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to promote standardized operations in digital commerce [@ONDCProject2022]. These initiatives reflect a growing emphasis on open standards across both public and private sectors in India, although challenges in implementation and enforcement persist.

#### Indonesia

[Although there are policies such as \"One Data Indonesia\" ("ODI") which aim to enhance government data interoperability and utilization [@swajatiKajianKebijakanDan2021],]{.mark}[^18] [Presidential Regulation No. 95/2018 on Electronic-Based Government System (SPBE) is]{.mark} [a reference in the development of SPBE for all government agencies and Digital Government in Indonesia; and]{.mark} [the Ministry of Communication and Information has issued Minister of Communication and Informatics Regulation Number 4 of 2016 concerning Information Security Management System (SMPI). Information Security Management System (SMPI)]{.mark} [has adopted the SNI/ISO standard 270001:2013 standard and can be adopted in the implementation of the Digital Government strategy to increase public trust.]{.mark}

#### Nepal

The National Cybersecurity Policy, 2080 (2023) encourages the use of open standards to facilitate interoperability and data exchange between various information technology systems and services [@NationalCyberSecurity2023a].[^19] However, it does not enforce their usage; rather, it encourages the adoption of globally recognized standards and software. Additionally, a representative from the Government Integrated Data Center and the Ministry of Communication and Technology articulated concerns regarding heightened vulnerabilities in data protection due to the utilization of open standards or open-source software. As mentioned above, the Nepal E-Government Interoperability Framework (the "NeGIF") highly recommends and encourages the use of open standards and open-source software for better interoperability to achieve the goal of better governance, providing faster services and reducing redundancy of information [@NepalEGovernmentInteroperability2011]. It provides for a comprehensive plan and detailed standards with the best practices around the world for the implementation of open source and open standard for interoperability. However, the NeGIF could not be implemented till now, despite being published in 2011. The failure of implementation of open standard policies is the main reason for the lack of interoperability within various government bodies and overlapping or delay in information sharing in government offices.

#### Pakistan

Currently there are no open standards mandated or preferred by the government. In the Digital Pakistan Policy, while discussing "IoT, FinTech, Artificial Intelligence & Robotics," there is only a mention of "open standards efforts."

#### Philippines

The Information and Communications Technology Office of the Department of Science and Technology issued circulars approving the Philippine Electronic Government Interoperability Framework (PeGIF) Version 1.0 for implementation by government agencies. PeGIF promised to implement specifications that comply with the definition of open standards, contribute to open systems, and are relevant to systems' interconnectivity, data integration, presentation and interface, e-services access, and content management metadata [@InteroperabilityStandards2021]. The Circulars do not, however, establish specific technical standards beyond general principles.

#### Sri Lanka

The Draft National Digital Government and Governance Policy of Sri Lanka talks about the Lanka Interoperability Framework (LIFe), a set of open standards to ensure the highest degree of operability and provide all government services through a single window. Presently, LIFe comprises the following domains: Personal Domain, Land Domain, Vehicle Domain, and Project Coordination Domain.

#### Thailand

In 2012, the Electronic Government Agency or the EGA (i.e., the predecessor of the DGA) published the first version of the Government Website Standard, a handbook containing information on, *inter alia*, recommended features, i.e., web designs and displays, languages (Thai and English) and fonts, and hyperlinks consistent with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) standards. The WCAG 2.0, introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is an international set of guidelines to increase web content accessibility, including to people with disabilities [@electronicgovernmentagencyGovernmentWebsiteStandard2012].[^20]

+===================================+========================================================================================+

While Thailand and the Philippines have data retention requirements across various sectors, as does India which has extensive data localization requirements affecting multiple sectors, including financial services, insurance, and corporate entities. Sri Lanka primarily focuses these obligations on the banking sector. Data localization is less developed in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, with the latter\'s requirements largely limited to financial institutions. Nepal\'s approach is more tentative, indicated through a non-legislative resolution. Data transfer obligations that may indirectly support data localization are seen in Thailand, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.

##### India

Data localization in India involves a set of legal frameworks that mandate the storage, processing, and management of certain categories of data within the country. The Official Secrets Act, 1923, restricts data flow by prohibiting the communication of sensitive information, emphasizing the importance of national security. The Act\'s broad powers allow the government to control the dissemination of information that might affect state interests, fostering a culture of secrecy.

The Reserve Bank of India\'s (RBI) Notification on Storage of Payment Data mandates that all payment-related data must be stored within India, ensuring tighter regulatory oversight and data security. Similarly, the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, and the amended Companies Act, 2013, require that financial records and other relevant documents are accessible within India, even if they are maintained electronically. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) also requires insurers to store policy-related records in domestic data centers. These rules limit the cross-border transfer of sensitive financial and corporate data, reinforcing India\'s jurisdiction over such information.

Additional regulations include the Cyber Security Directions, 2022, issued by CERT-In, which impose data localization requirements on digital personal data, prohibit anonymous VPN usage, and require identity verification of data users. The Unified Access License by the Department of Telecommunications restricts the transfer of customer information outside India and imposes surveillance obligations on service providers. Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) framework mandates that data related to SEBI-regulated entities, including financial institutions using Software as a Service (SaaS), must be stored within India.

##### Indonesia

PDP Law distinguishes the previously known electronic system provider, into Personal Data Controllers ("Data Controllers") and Personal Data Processors ("Data Processors"). The Data Controllers determine the purpose and control the processing of personal data, while the Data Processors act on behalf of the Data Controllers to perform the processing of personal data. The Data Controllers must ensure that there is adequate and binding protection, or at the very least, consent must be given from the personal data subjects. PDP Law restricts any person to: (a) unlawfully obtain/collect personal data that does not belong to them, with the intention to benefit themselves or other persons which will be disadvantageous to the Personal Data Subject; (b) unlawfully disclose and use personal data that does not belong to them; (c) create false personal data with the intention to benefit themselves or other persons which may result in the loss of other persons.

##### Nepal

There are provisions in the RTI (Right to Information) Act for classification of information [@RightInformationAct2007][^21] and keeping information confidential for a maximum period of 30 years [@RightInformationAct2007].[^22] However, it is not explicitly stated whether these provisions apply specifically to personal data for security purposes. While the laws of Nepal are silent on data residency or data localization, there is a cabinet decision which states that all the data and information technology of the government of Nepal shall be stored and managed in the Government Integrated Data Center along with the Disaster Recovery Center located in Kathmandu and Hetauda respectively.[^23] Although the Cabinet decision also does not explicitly talk about data localization, while interviewing various government personnel it has come to light that the intent of the government of Nepal is to store data collected in Nepal within the territory of Nepal.

##### Pakistan

Pakistan's approach to data localization has been complex, with multiple laws, regulations, and policies developed over the years. Localization was first alluded to in the Pakistan Broadband Policy (2004), by referring to \"locally located content\" with the motivation to host websites locally for reducing reliance on international bandwidth. However, subsequent references have been more explicit. For example, the Pakistan Cloud First Policy prescribes that data localization is a rule and transborder data flow is an exception subject to permission. This sentiment is echoed in the current draft of the Draft Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, which adds a special category of critical personal data, in addition to the usual personal data and sensitive personal data to justify the data localization ambition.

There are also data localizations requirements in other laws and policies in Pakistan:

Pakistan Broadband Policy refers to "locally located content" with the motivation to host websites locally.

Pakistan Cloud First Policy requires that whenever there are legitimate use-cases requiring cross-border data flows, then the relevant stakeholders may consult with the Cloud Office established under the policy, to ensure appropriate security standards and controls are in place for such data flows.

Email and Internet Policy for the Federal government says that government entities shall only use government data centers. If that is not available, services of local ISPs will only be used.

Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules, 2021 prescribes that a significant social media company must register with PTA, establish an office in Pakistan, appoint an authorized compliance officer, and a dedicated grievance officer, both based in Pakistan and comply with the user data privacy and data localization requirements.

Cyber Security Strategy for Telecom Sector 2023-2028 developed under Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996 requires Critical Telecom Data (CTD) to reside within the geographical boundaries of Pakistan. However, the localization requirement is only limited to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and CTD.

Draft Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill adds a special category of critical personal data to the localization requirement.

##### Philippines

The 2012 Data Privacy Act requires that personal information must be retained only for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes for which the data was obtained or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for legitimate purposes or as provided by law. The Philippines has no law governing data localization, although the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has prescribed the Philippine Government's Cloud First Policy, which includes a provision on data residency. The residency restrictions generally do not apply to government data stored or processed in the cloud, provided that appropriate controls or security measures are present. However, sensitive, above-sensitive, and highly sensitive government data may be subject to some residency restrictions [@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020].[^24]

##### Sri Lanka

Section 9 of the Personal Data Protection Act mandates that personal details should only be maintained for a period that is necessary or required for specific purpose. As for data localization, the Regulatory Framework on Technology Risk Management and Resilience for Licensed Banks and Banking Direction No. 16 of 2021 mandates that 'Domestic Systematically Important Banks' must have Critical Information systems in place. For such systems (including those used for Know Your Customer or KYC), disaster recovery arrangements must be located locally [@srilankaBankingActDirections2021]. Additionally, third-party service providers such as cloud servers located outside Sri Lanka must be approved by the licensed Bank\'s Board of Directors and comply with certain conditions.

##### Thailand

There are two main laws which impose regulations on data retention. The first is the Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560 (2017), and the second is the Personal Data Protection Act B.E.2562 (2019). The former requires service providers to retain traffic data for at least 90 days from the date the data entered the computer system. In addition, it must store the user's data, for identification purposes, for at least 90 days after the expiration date of a service [@ComputerRelatedCrimeAct2007].[^25] The Personal Data Protection Act makes it compulsory for data controllers to specify the period of data retention (in accordance with the purpose of the personal data collection) and inform data subjects prior or during the consent request [@PersonalDataProtection2019].[^26] In addition, data controllers have a duty to delete or destroy the personal data after the data retention has expired [@PersonalDataProtection2019].[^27]

#### Restrictions on Right to Information

**2. Are there any restrictions to the right to access information such as national security, public order, privacy, etc.?**

Every country studied has exemptions in place which restrict access to information on the grounds similar to national security, public order, privacy, etc. either by incorporating such restrictions in the Constitution itself or by introducing them in statutes or legislations.

##### India

In India, the Right to Information (RTI) Act includes several exceptions to the disclosure of information. Information may be withheld if its release could harm national security, strategic interests, or international relations, or if it has been restricted by a court order. Additionally, details that might breach parliamentary privilege, affect commercial or intellectual property interests, or endanger individuals are exempt. Confidential information from foreign governments, ongoing investigations, and personal data are also protected.

Certain organizations, such as intelligence and security agencies, are exempt from the RTI Act, though information related to allegations of corruption or human rights violations must be disclosed with appropriate approvals.

Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 also restricts access by criminalizing the wrongful communication of classified information. This includes any data related to prohibited areas or matters that could impact national security or foreign relations. The Act penalizes the unauthorized sharing or misuse of such information, as well as the failure to secure or properly manage classified documents. In case of any conflict between the laws, the RTI Act takes precedence due to Section 22 of the Act, which explicitly states that "The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1923..."

##### Indonesia

The RTI Law adopts a "right" of public agencies to refuse access to public information. Nevertheless, the institution is required to explain all exemptions restrictively and the information may not stay restricted permanently. Information that should be exempt from public access relates to law enforcement, intellectual property, fair competition practices, defense and security of the state, natural wealth, national economic security, diplomatic relations, personal secrets, and similar.

The rights of Personal Data Subjects excluded for the interests of national defense and security; the interests of the law enforcement process; the public interest in the framework of state administration; the interests of supervision of the financial services sector, monetary, payment systems, and the stability of the financial system carried out in the framework of state administration; or the interests of statistics and scientific research.

##### Nepal

The explicit right to communication provision in the Constitution of Nepal can be restricted on some grounds, such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, harmony between communities, public morals, contempt and sedition. The Telecommunication Act, 2053 (1997) gives special power to the Government of Nepal where it can control or stop transmission of information in the state of emergency or national security in the country [@nepalTelecommunicationsAct1993].[^28] The Press and Publications Act, 2048 (1991) provides for restriction [@PressPublicationAct1991][^29] and prohibition [@PressPublicationAct1991][^30] on publication on any matter which undermines the sovereignty and integrity of Nepal or, disrupts security, peace and order or, creates enmity among the people of various castes, tribes, religions, classes, region, communities and spreading communal disharmony or, hurting decency, morals and social honor of the people PressPublicationAct1991.[^31] It also provides for the restriction on imports of foreign publications along the same lines [@PressPublicationAct1991].[^32]

##### Pakistan

The Right of Access to Information Act in Pakistan contains several exceptions that restrict the right to access information including public interest, privacy, confidentiality, international relations, prevention of an offence, etc. The Federal Government has also framed the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules, 2021, under the Telecom Act which gives the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority the power of removal or blocking access to online content in the interest of glory of Islam, security of Pakistan, public order, decency and morality and security or defense of Pakistan. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) occasionally halts broadcasts and closes media outlets under Section 30 of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 depriving viewers of necessary access to information and data.

##### Philippines

The Memorandum from the Executive Secretary dated 24 November 2016, also known as the Inventory of Exceptions to Executive Order No. 2 (S. 2016), lists several restrictions on the right to access information. These include the doctrine of executive privilege, information related to national security, defense, or international relations, law enforcement and protection of public and personal safety, confidentiality, and privacy [@InventoryExceptionsExecutive2016]. The 1997 Indigenous People's Rights Act, which grants the Indigenous peoples of Philippines ownership and control over their cultural and intellectual property, including their genetic data and biological resources within ancestral lands and domains, requires the free and prior informed consent of the indigenous communities before such data can be accessed [@IndigenousPeoplesRights1997]. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 along with a number of other sectoral laws such as the 2004 Violence Against Women and Their Children Act, the 2022 Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Materials Act, etc. also impose restrictions on the processing and sharing of personal data, both by government agencies and private entities.

##### Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has restrictions on the constitutional right to access information such as national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals and of the reputation or the rights of others, privacy, prevention of contempt of court, protection of parliamentary privilege, for preventing the disclosure of information communicated in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary [@ConstitutionSL2023].[^33] Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 (as amended) ("SLTA"), Computer Crime Act No. 24 of 2007, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act No. 56 of 2007, the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979 and Public Security Ordinance No 25 of 1947 (in the event of an emergency being declared). The Online Safety Act No 9 of 2024 with its broad provisions seeks to regulate disinformation online, amongst others [@OnlineSafetyAct2024a].

##### Thailand

Under the 2017 Thai Constitution, the constitutional rights and liberties may be restricted or limited by law for the protection of national security and the preservation of public order. The Constitutional obligation to disclose public information under Section 59 of the Constitution does not apply to information relating to national security and state secrets. Additionally, Section 32 of the 2017 Thai Constitution guarantees the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, and the Personal Data Protection Act B.E.2562 (2019) is consistent with this protection. The Computer-Related Crime Act (No.2) B.E.2560 (2017) also provides mechanisms for restricting access to information deemed to constitute national security or terrorism-related offences, while the Rule on Maintenance of Official Secrets B.E. 2544 (2001) lays down a practical framework on how to categorize and treat different types of "official secrets" (which are categorized into confidential, secret and top-secret information).

+===================================+============================================================================================================================+

All the countries have an exception to their data security framework for law enforcement in some form or the other. This exception is usually crafted in broad terms but, generally speaking, deals with the investigation and prevention of crimes. While the Philippines and Nepal give the power to pass such orders to the judicial system, etc. the courts, in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India this power is exercised by the law enforcement agencies themselves.

##### India

Various laws have provisions for surveillance and interception for law enforcement purposes, including Sections 69 and 69B of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Section 20 of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 (replacing Section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885). These provisions, along with the rules made thereunder, allow for interception of electronic communications and for compelled decryption of communications. Section 26 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, empowers the central and state government to intercept postal articles.

Section 94 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (which replaced the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) allows any court in India or any officer in charge of a police station to summon a person to produce any document or any other thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding. Section 95 allows for the interception of a document, parcel or thing in the possession of a postal or telegraph authority. Surveillance procedures are also covered under various states' Police Acts and the national Model Police Manual.

Section 17(1)(c) of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 exempts the application of the much of the law when "personal data is processed in the interest of prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of any offence or contravention of any law for the time being in force in India". Section 17(2)(a) provides a wide-ranging exemption for "such instrumentality of the State as the Central Government may notify, in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, maintenance of public order or preventing incitement to any cognizable offence relating to any of these." The government will presumably notify intelligence agencies under this provision.

##### Indonesia

The PDP Law exception of protection data personal can be limited or exempted subject to the implementation of laws and regulations for the following reasons:

a.  national defense and security interests;

b.  law enforcement process interests;

c.  public interest, for the purpose of state administration;

d.  the interests of supervision of the financial services sector, monetary, payment systems, and financial systems stability carried out in the context of state administration; or

e.  general statistical and scientific research interests.

All exemptions except for the one relating to the "natural wealth" of Indonesia are subject to a harm test. Equally, there is a mandatory public interest override applicable to all exemptions; should revealing the information serve a "larger interest," the otherwise protected information shall be released to the public [@PublicInformationDisclosure2008].[^34] The RTI Act provides for internal and external appeal options. Internally, the appeal is with the supervisor of the information officer. An external administrative appeal is possible with the Information Committee, an independent institution competent for overseeing the implementation of the RTI Act. It consists of the central, provincial, and, if required, district/municipal Information Committees [@PublicInformationDisclosure2008].[^35]

##### Nepal

There is no provision or facility for internet surveillance in Nepal. There are no resources available for the surveillance on the customer browsing and tracking the web history of each citizen. However, if a court orders an internet service provider or telecommunication service provider to record the data of any individual and make available such data, only after the date of such an order can the service provider record and store such data. But through our interviews, it came to light that even if the court orders for surveillance of any individual, the service providers face problems while retrieving such data or most of the service providers do not have the resources for the same. Therefore, the order of the court becomes impractical or ineffective due to the limitations of the service providers.

##### Pakistan

Under Section 54 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996, the Federal Government has the power to authorize any person to intercept calls and messages violating the privacy of individuals in the national interest or on the mere apprehension of an offence. Under the same section, in case of proclamation of emergency, hostilities or war, the Federal Government can take over or suspend the operations or services of any service provider thereby depriving their customers from using the telecommunication networks. Under Sections 31 and 35 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, the authorized officers have sweeping powers to require any person to provide any data in decrypted form, if the authorized officer is satisfied that it is required for an investigation and there is risk of it being modified, lost or destroyed.

##### Philippines

The Bill of Rights of the Philippine Constitution specifically guarantees that "the privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable, except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise, as prescribed by law." In connection with cybercrime offences, the interception of computer data by law enforcement authorities may be authorized by the trial courts by virtue of a warrant to intercept computer data that allows authorities to listen, record, monitor or surveil the content of communications including the procuring of content of computer data through access and use of a computer system [@RuleCybercrimeWarrants2018]. The application for the warrant must establish, among others, the existence of a probable cybercrime offence, and the communication or computer data that is sought to be intercepted.

In connection with suspected terrorists or members of terrorist organizations, the 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act allows for the Court of Appeals to issue an order authorizing law enforcement or military to secretly wiretap, listen to, or intercept any private communications between such suspects [@AntiTerrorismAct2020]. The order may be issued by the Court of Appeals upon determination that there is probable cause that any of the crimes defined under the Anti-Terrorism Act has been, is being, or is about to be committed.

##### Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka, whilst prohibiting unauthorized/unlawful interception by several statutes, does not have a specific legislation/policy addressing lawful interception of telecommunication and electronic communication content. However, in certain circumstances interception of data, may be permitted:

**(1)** **Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act:** Section 69 of the Act states that if, due to any public emergency or in the interest of public safety and tranquility, it is expedient or necessary that the transmission and reception of messages by telecommunications should be prohibited or be subject to supervision and control, the Minister may issue a direction either (i) generally and published in the Gazette or (ii) specifically in writing in respect of any telecommunications service provided in any place in Sri Lanka, the Minister may also prescribe the conditions and restrictions subject to which messages may be transmitted or received and make such provision as he may deem necessary for the interception or the censoring of all or any specified class or description of messages (Section 69(b)).[^36]

**(2)** **Public Security Ordinance**: Emergency Regulations, when made, override all laws of the country except the Constitution. Accordingly, in an instance where the President declares a state of emergency, the President in his sole discretion may set out any regulation that he deems fit and this may include regulation to intercept, retain and/or disclose any telecommunication or electronic communication content.

**(3) Computer Crime Act**: Under Section 18 of the Act, a police officer or expert for the purposes of investigation may intercept communication subject to a warrant being issued by a Magistrate. The requirement of a warrant for interception can be waived on grounds of urgency; evidence being lost / destroyed; and requirement of confidentiality.

##### Thailand

There are certain pieces of legislation that allow authorities to conduct surveillance and intercept information and data from individuals. Most of these laws are related to the prevention and suppression of crimes. Each provides different grounds for requesting a warrant for surveillance and interception. These include the National Intelligence Act B.E. 2562 (2019), the Narcotics Control Act B.E. 2519 (1976), the Anti-Money Laundering Act B.E. 2542 (1999), the Special Case Investigation Act B.E. 2547 (2004), and the Anti-Participation in Transnational Organized Crime Act B.E. 2556 (2013). Normally, the power to consider and grant a warrant lies with the court.

|                                   | - Personal Data Committee's Announcement on the Criteria for Protecting Personal Data Sent or Transferred Abroad |
+===================================+==================================================================================================================+

Most countries with specific data protection or privacy legislations have imposed certain conditions on cross border data transfers, the most important and common of the conditions being that the country where the data is being transferred should have adequate data protection requirements, although the level of adequacy and how it is to be ensured differs from country to country.

##### India

Section 16 of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 allows for the cross-border transfer of personal data, except when they fall under notified categories. As of August 2025, the categories have not yet been notified. Yet, there are many sectoral regulations that limit cross-border transfer of various kinds of personal data.

##### Indonesia

The Law on P2SK includes provisions related to consumer data protection and outlines guidelines for transferring consumer data to third parties, both within and outside the jurisdiction of Indonesia such as Article 241, which permits the transfer of consumer data outside Indonesia\'s legal jurisdiction while adhering to data protection regulations. In the banking sector Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 3 of 2023 requires banking and non-banking entities supervised by Bank Indonesia to obtain consumer consent before transferring their personal data.

Cross-border transfer of personal data is allowed with the condition that the Data Controllers must ensure the recipient country has an equal or higher personal data protection governance than the PDP Law. If these provisions cannot be met, the Data Controllers must ensure that there is adequate and binding protection, or at the very least, consent must be given from the personal data subjects. Failure to comply with this provision will be subject to administrative sanction. Further details on the cross-border transfer of personal data will be elaborated under a government regulation.

##### Nepal

There are no specific laws concerning special requirements for data transfer and/or data storage out of Nepalese jurisdiction, including sharing it with affiliated companies and vendors that may be located in other countries.

##### Pakistan

Pakistan\'s Draft privacy law imposes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Specifically, the law restricts the flow of personal data across borders, which is limited only to critical personal data. The draft PDP allows free flow personal data with consent of the data subject, but the sector regulators like SBP and PTA force their licensees to keep the personal data within Pakistan.

##### Philippines

There are no particular restrictions on cross-border data transfers. However, under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, as the definition of processing as "any operation or any set of operations performed upon personal information", any transfer of personal data (whether within or across borders) would be considered as processing, which can only be permitted if it fulfils any of the criteria as enumerated under Section 12 and Section 13 (for sensitive personal information) of the law. The Data Privacy Act also requires that the personal information controller remains accountable for personal information that has been transferred to a third party for processing, whether domestically or internationally.

##### Sri Lanka

Under Section 26 of the Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022, cross-border data transfers are permitted for private entities provided an "adequacy decision" has been taken or where certain other contractual conditions are satisfied or where conditions for lawful processing such as consent are satisfied. It is to be noted that the PDPA provides for different conditions for cross border transfer of data by State and non-State entities [@srilankaPersonalDataProtection2022].

##### Thailand

The provision which regulates the transfer of personal data from Thailand to other countries can be found in Section 28 of the PDPA B.E.2562 (2019), which requires the destination country or international organization to have adequate data protection standard and also implement appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data while it is being transferred and stored outside of Thailand. In December 2023, the Personal Data Committee issued the Committee's Announcement on the Criteria for Protecting Personal Data Sent or Transferred Abroad including the factors to be considered when examining "appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data" [@royalgazetteAnnouncementPersonalData2023].

+===================================+=====================================================================================================+

##### India

India\'s data protection law seems to put a complete bar on web scraping for any purpose, including search engines and machine learning. Web scraping is covered by the data protection law, since only \"publicly available personal data\" that\'s been made available by the data principal or under a legal requirement is exempted from the application of the data protection law. Clearly, even personal data on an encyclopedia like Wikipedia gets covered since it wouldn't have been made available by the data subject herself. Further, it is impossible to determine when scraping exabytes of data from the public Web whether any personal data has been made publicly available by the data subject/principal or someone else, or whether it has been made publicly available under a law.

The only ground for processing of such personal data would seem to be consent, under Section 6 of the DPDP Act. Clearly it is impossible to identify and scrape personal contact details of billions of living persons (without obtaining their consent) in order to obtain their consent for further scraping of their personal data.

Lastly, the only exception to consent that might possibly be of interest in this case is that of Section 17(1)(c), which creates an exception in cases where the processing of personal data is "necessary for research, archiving or statistical purposes if the personal data is not to be used to take any decision specific to a Data Principal and such processing is carried on in accordance with such standards as may be prescribed."

##### Indonesia

PDP Law distinguishes the previously known electronic system provider, into Personal Data Controllers ("Data Controllers") and Personal Data Processors ("Data Processors"). The Data Controllers determine the purpose and control the processing of personal data, while the Data Processors act on behalf of the Data Controllers to perform the processing of personal data. Cross-border transfer of personal data is allowed with the condition that the Data Controllers must ensure the recipient country has an equal or higher personal data protection governance than the PDP Law. One of Rights of the Personal Data Owner the notable rights of the personal data subjects based on the PDP Law is Rights to object on any decision made which was based on an automated decision-making process, including profiling, which may expose the personal data subjects to legal consequences or significant impact, which means the activity of web scraping.

The Data Controllers must ensure that there is adequate and binding protection, or at the very least, consent must be given from the personal data subjects. Failure to comply with this provision will be subject to administrative sanction. Prohibitions in the Use of Personal Data PDP Law prohibits any person to: (a) unlawfully obtain/collect personal data that does not belong to them, with the intention to benefit themselves or other persons which will be disadvantageous to the Personal Data Subject; (b) unlawfully disclose and use personal data that does not belong to them; (c) create false personal data with the intention to benefit themselves or other persons which may result in the loss of other persons.

##### Nepal

There are no exceptions or exemptions (either full or limited) under data protection laws for large-scale data scraping.

##### Pakistan

The draft Personal Data Protection Bill does not explicitly mention any exception or exemption for the functioning of search engines. The only ground for processing of such personal data under Section 6 of the PDP Bill is consent of the data subject. However, under sub-section (6) of Section 6, a data controller may process the personal data of a data subject, if the processing is necessary, amongst others, for legitimate interests pursued by the data controller. But the catch is that the term "legitimate interest" in the PDP means anything permitted under the law. It is therefore safe to assume that the PDP Bill does not recognize web scraping for any purpose, including search engines and machine learning, therefore making it illegal.

##### Philippines

There are no particular accommodations under the Philippine Data Privacy Act or its implementing rules as to the practice of web scraping. The extent of public availability of personal information is not a consideration at all when it comes to the application of the data protection law. Thus, the processing of such information, including that obtained via web scraping, must be justified by lawful basis as enumerated under the Section 12 and 13 of the Data Privacy Act. The consent of the data subject to such processing is one such lawful basis.

Ostensibly, personal information processed for research purposes is specifically excluded from the scope of the Data Privacy Act, according to Section 4. However, the Implementing Rules to the Act further added that the research "should be intended for a public benefit \[and\] subject to the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, or ethical standards." Owing to that caveat, and due also to the absence thus far of any clarifying issuance as to the meaning of "public benefit", researchers in the Philippines have as a matter of practice strived instead to obtain the consent of data subjects as much as practicable.

Outside of consent, Section 12 of the Data Privacy Act allows as a lawful basis for processing personal information such processing as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by third parties to whom such data is disclosed. However, such legitimate interest may be overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under the Philippine Constitution. Further, the legitimate interest basis does not apply to sensitive personal information such as about an individual's race, marital status, age, health, education or sexual life.

##### Sri Lanka

The Data Protection Act, 2022 does not specifically mention that "publicly available data" or those obtained from public sources are exempted from its application. However, under Schedule V, (Collection of Personal Data) it has been stated that where personal data has been collected by means other than direct interaction with the data subject, details of such collection of data including the publicly available sources must be provided to the data subject. It can be deduced that web scraping can be done provided the data subject is made aware of that. Providing such notice is, of course, impossible when one is scraping billions of web pages.

While the lawful bases for processing of data in Sri Lanka include "legitimate interests" and the explanation for the same includes instances where "a data subject reasonably expects at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place," as under Schedule V (Collection of Personal Data), the legitimate interest pursued by the Controller should be disclosed to the data subject. Therefore, even where web scraping can be considered as a legitimate interest, such reasoning should be disclosed to the data subject.

##### Thailand

The Personal Data Protection Act 2019 is the primary legislation that safeguards individuals\' personal data in Thailand. It does not include any specific provisions related to web scraping or AI training. However, Section 4(3) of the Act specifies that it does not apply to the use of personal data collected solely for activities related to mass media, fine arts, or literature, provided these activities adhere to professional ethics or serve the public interest. This suggests that web scraping and the extraction of personal data already available from such activities are not regulated by the Personal Data Protection Act.

### Copyright

#### Research

**1. Does copyright law recognize an exception for research purposes?**

Thailand, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines have specific exemptions in their copyright laws for use for research purposes, though restricted in many cases. While Nepal doesn't provide an exception for research, it still covers educational purposes and libraries.

+===================================+=========================================================================+

##### India

India does not provide a generic fair use (criteria-based) exception for copyright infringement but instead provides for specific exceptions under Section 52 of the Copyright Act. Copyright is not infringed if one engages in 'fair dealing' for "private or personal use, including research." Thus, research has to be for "private or personal" purposes. This exception does not cover computer software. Separately from research purposes, the Copyright Act also provides for exceptions for the purposes of teaching in classrooms and for libraries.

##### Indonesia

Article 44 of the Copyright Law stipulates that the use, retrieval, duplication, and/or alteration of a Creation and/or a product of Related Rights in whole or in substantial part shall not be deemed an infringement of Copyright if the source is fully mentioned or included for the purposes of (a) education, research, writing scientific papers, preparing reports, writing criticism or reviewing a problem without harming the reasonable interests of the Creator or Copyright Holder.

##### Nepal

Although the Copyright Act may not specifically provide an exception for research purposes, it does outline a few exceptions where copyrighted materials can be used without the authorization of the copyright owner or author, provided such use is not prejudicial to the economic rights of the copyright owner. These exceptions include;

\(i\) reproduction for personal purpose [@nepalCopyrightAct2002];[^37]

\(ii\) citation [@nepalCopyrightAct2002];[^38]

\(iii\) teaching and learning, which includes reproduction of a small portion of any published work by way of citation, writing, or audio-visual aid, and for educational activities performed in the classroom [@nepalCopyrightAct2002];[^39]

\(iv\) library and archives, where one copy can be reproduced in case copyright work is destroyed or is old [@nepalCopyrightAct2002];[^40]

\(v\) dissemination of information to the general public via broadcasting or print newspaper [@nepalCopyrightAct2002];[^41] and

\(vi\) importation of one copy of a work for personal use [@nepalCopyrightAct2002].[^42]

Therefore, from the given provisions of the Copyright Act, it can be inferred that there is no implied exception for the use of copyrighted work for research purposes.

##### Pakistan

According to Section 57 of the Copyright Ordinance 1962, a fair dealing with the copyrighted material for the purpose of research and private study does not constitute an infringement.

##### Philippines

Under Philippine copyright law, there are exceptions that allow for the use of copyrighted works for research purposes without infringing on the copyright owner\'s rights. Section 185 of the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 8293) provides for the fair use of copyrighted works for certain purposes, including research.

##### Sri Lanka

The Intellectual Property Rights Act No 36 of 2003 governs copyrights and related rights in Sri Lanka. Section 11 of the Act (Fair use) recognizes exceptions for research purposes [@srilankaIntellectualPropertyAct2003]. Section 11(1) states, "Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of section 9, the fair use of a work, including such use by reproduction in copies or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship or research, shall not be an infringement of copyright."

##### Thailand

Copyright law in Thailand recognizes exceptions for research purposes. Section 32(1) of the Copyright Act (No.5) B.E.2565 (2022) provides an exemption for using copyrighted work for research, provided that such research is not conducted for profit. This exemption allows researchers to use copyrighted materials for non-commercial research purposes without infringing on the rights of copyright holders.

**2. Does copyright law have any exemptions for training AI models or for search engines?**

General Comment: None of the countries studied, with the possible exception of India, have specific exceptions for training AI models, while some like Thailand and India have exceptions that cover search engines' storage of copyrighted materials, as those are "incidental."

+===================================+===================================================================+

##### India

The Copyright Act, 1957 provides a specific exception that covers web scraping for search engines in the form of Section 52(1)(c), which creates an exception for "transient or incidental storage of a work or performance for the purpose of providing electronic links, access or integration, where such links, access or integration has not been expressly prohibited by the right holder...." While this does not explicitly cover scraping of training data for machine learning purposes, it is arguable that if standards like robots.txt are followed, the "integration" that the scraped training data allows for is possibly protected. It is unclear what "integration" means in this context, nor are there any judicial cases on this matter.

##### Indonesia

There is no exception in Indonesian copyright law which would allow for web scraping, for instance for indexation by search engines or for the training of machine learning models. Thus, presumably, search engines and most generative AI models are unlawful in Indonesia.

##### Nepal

The Copyright Act, 2059 (2002) stipulates that data or databases, whether machine-readable or not, are protected under copyright law. While 'general data' is excluded from copyright protection, it does provide protection for two kinds of work, i.e., artistic work and literary work. Computer programs come under the purview of artistic work.

The exceptions provided under Chapter 4 of the Copyright Act do not address the use of generative AI or the reproduction of copyrighted work as part of the training data for AI or as part of the cache for search engines. As a result, the use of copyrighted work by AI, even for training purposes, is considered illegal in Nepal since the current laws do not accommodate such uses.

##### Pakistan

Section 57 of the Copyright Ordinance 1962 provides that fair dealing with the copyrighted material for the purpose of research does not constitute infringement. In that context, the training of AI models only for research purposes would not be an infringement. Similarly, presumably, a reasonable amount of copyrighted material displayed by search engines ought not to be a violation of copyright.

##### Philippines

There are no specific laws or regulations in the Philippines that intentionally regulate web scraping. However, under the 1997 Intellectual Property Code, compilations of data and other materials which are original by reason of the selection or coordination or arrangement of their contents enjoy copyright protection. The Code also states that copyright applies as a general rule to literary, scholarly, scientific and artistic works by the sole fact of their creation, irrespective of their mode or form of expression, as well as of their content, quality and purpose.

Thus, presumably, data scraping by search engine web crawlers, or usage of such data for training of machine learning models is a violation of copyright.

##### Sri Lanka

The Intellectual Property Rights Act No 36 of 2003 governs copyrights and related rights in Sri Lanka [@srilankaIntellectualPropertyAct2003]. The Act does not recognize any exemptions for training AI models. Further, the Intellectual Property Rights Act 2003 does not contain take down provisions or provisions for the transient or incidental storage of a work or performance for the process of electronic transmission or communication to the public (for example, provisions similar to the amendments introduced in 2012 to the Indian Copyright Act) [@IndiaCopyrightAmendmentAct2012]. The lack of such amendments means that there are no provisions under Sri Lankan law to legalize the transient or incidental storage of works carried out by search engines such as Google.

##### Thailand

The Department of Intellectual Property and the Central Intellectual Property and International Trade Court have not provided any comments regarding copyrighted work used to train AI yet. However, Thailand\'s copyright law provides exemptions for the display of works by search engines. Sections 43/1 and 43/5 of the Copyright Act (No.5) B.E.2565 (2022) outline conditions under which search engines can operate without infringing copyright. These provisions exempt search engine service providers from liability if they meet certain criteria such as not having knowledge of infringement, no direct financial benefit from copyright-infringing activity, providing contact information for receiving notifications of copyright infringement, etc.

As far as machine learning is concerned, there is no specific provision that addresses web scraping for the purpose of training AI. Thus, general copyright principles apply, meaning that web scraping which pulls copyrighted work for the purpose of training machines without permission from the copyright holders is likely to constitute a copyright violation if the use of copyrighted work to train AI does not fall within the scope of the exemptions described above. It is important to note that, at present, neither the Department of Intellectual Property (DIP) nor the Central Intellectual Property and International Trade Court have provided any guidance on the use of copyrighted material to train AI yet.

#### AI authorship

**3. Does copyright law recognize copyright in works generated by AI?**

None of the jurisdictions studied specifically grant copyright to literary, artistic, musical, etc., works generated by AI, but none explicitly prohibit copyright existing over such works. The Indian law specifically provides authorship over computer-generated works to the person who causes the work to be created.

###### **Table 14: Recognition of copyright in work generated by AI**

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Thailand                          | - None                                                       |
+===================================+==============================================================+

##### India

Section 2(d)(vi) of the Copyright Act explicitly states that authorship in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, vests with the person who causes the work to be created. The law does not lay down whether AI-generated works can be copyrighted, and there is no case law on this matter.

Copyright in literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works can only subsist if the work is "original." In *Modak v. EBC*, the Indian Supreme Court adopted the Canadian Supreme Court's "skill and judgement" standard for the test of originality. Thus, presumably, an AI-generated work is not automatically outside the purview of copyrightability and may fall within the purview of copyrightability if it in some way embodies the author's "skill and judgement," even if not creativity.

##### Indonesia

The Indonesian copyright law does not recognize AI as a creator or copyright holder. The definition of creator in Article 1 number 2, which is "a person" or "several persons" who individually or collectively produce distinctive and personal works. Furthermore, Article 1 number 27 defines "a person" or "several persons" as individuals or legal entities. Thus, creator and/or copyright holder only refers to humans in the biological sense and legal entities, not to non-humans such as AI. Therefore, as yet, AI cannot be classified as a legal subject.

##### Nepal

The laws of Nepal are silent on the issue of copyright in work generated by AI and do not explicitly address AI. Therefore, it can be concluded that the copyright law of Nepal does not recognize copyright in work generated by AI.

##### Philippines

Philippines' copyright law does not specifically recognize copyright in works purely generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Under the Philippine Intellectual Property Code, copyright over original literary and artistic works generally belongs to the author, who under the law, is defined as a "natural person."

##### Pakistan

The copyright Ordinance 1962 does not recognize the work generated by AI. The Ordinance assumes the "author" to be a natural person.

##### Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka's copyright law does not specifically recognize copyright in works purely generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

##### Thailand

Thailand\'s Department of Intellectual Property (DIP) does not currently recognize copyright in works purely generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

# Conclusions

## Commonalities & divergences in data governance architecture

\(i\) What is common, and what is nationally specific, in the emerging data governance architectures in South and Southeast Asia? What are the explanations?

Emerging data governance architectures in South and Southeast Asia exhibit both common trends and significant national differences, shaped by legal traditions, governmental capacities, and the influence of global frameworks like the EU's GDPR. A shared commitment to transparency and open data is evident, but the effectiveness and implementation of these policies vary across countries, reflecting their unique legal and administrative landscapes.

One prominent commonality is the adoption of the right to information (RTI) across the region. In South Asia, countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan have enshrined RTI as a constitutional right. India's legislation has paved the way for transparency, with Sri Lanka setting a high standard for the region. Yet, both these countries have struggled with enforcement of their laws. Pakistan struggles with inadequate resources for its Information Commission, leading to challenges in effective implementation. These examples underscore the importance of both legal frameworks and the internal political will and capacity to enforce them.

Open data initiatives are another area of convergence. Most countries in the region, including India, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have developed open data policies and portals. India stands out with its policies promoting governmental use of open standards and free/libre/open source software (FOSS), facilitating broader access to data. Conversely, Nepal lacks a unified open data portal, and Pakistan's portal is operated by a university, highlighting the challenges these countries face in integrating open data initiatives into government operations. In Sri Lanka, efforts to improve open data have been made but with limited success, further illustrating the gap between policy and practice in some nations.

Legal traditions significantly influence data governance structures. Civil law countries like Indonesia and Thailand have established comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Indonesia's RTI Law and Personal Data Protection Law (PDP) govern public and private data, respectively, with the One Data Initiative aiming to standardize data across government agencies. Thailand's Digitalization of Public Administration and Services Delivery Act sets a unified standard for public data governance, though national security laws still exert considerable influence. These frameworks contrast with the more fragmented approaches in common law countries like Pakistan and Nepal, where data governance is less cohesive, with a mix of sector-specific regulations and guidelines.

National specificities also arise from the adaptation of international models. Thailand, for example, has drawn heavily from the EU's GDPR in shaping its Personal Data Protection Act, integrating principles such as consent and data subject rights, while India has drawn on some of the GDPR, but left out much more. This highlights how countries are selectively adopting international best practices to fit their domestic contexts. However, in Nepal, the hesitancy towards open-source solutions due to perceived security risks reflects how lack of knowledge and lobbying by corporations can prevent adoption of global trends.

In summary, while South and Southeast Asian countries share broad goals in data governance, such as promoting transparency and open data, the paths they take and the outcomes they achieve are highly varied. These differences are influenced by each country's legal traditions, governmental capacity, and the specific challenges they face in aligning with international standards and addressing domestic needs. The examples of India's leadership in open data, Indonesia's comprehensive legal frameworks, and Nepal's cautious approach to open-source software demonstrate the diverse strategies these countries are employing in their data governance efforts.

## Frictions within policies

\(ii\) What are the implications of the emergent nature of the governance architecture? Because there is no overall design that envisions how the parts fit together, it is likely that there will be friction points and even contradictions. How are these being worked out?

Apart from traditional frictions, such as those between national security and transparency, or privacy and openness, there are also others that have emerged, such as the frictions between interoperability and innovation, between privacy-by-design and fraud detection and management.

## Trade-offs among data governance objectives

\(iii\) The emerging governance architecture involves tradeoffs among objectives such as greater accountability of powerholders, economic growth including creation of employment and wealth, resilience of systems, etc. How have different societies: (a) explicitly recognized the tradeoffs or not; and (b) handled them?

Across various countries, the governance of data and related trade-offs---between privacy, transparency, national security, and economic development---are largely managed implicitly rather than explicitly. While the objectives of these governance frameworks often clash, the decision-making processes in most countries do not fully recognize or articulate these trade-offs, leading to outcomes that are often opaque and inconsistent.

In India, the handling of trade-offs is particularly complex. The implementation of Aadhaar, India\'s national biometric identification system, illustrates this. Aadhaar does not record the \'purpose\' of an authentication, which is beneficial from a privacy-by-design perspective. However, this also increases the risk of identity fraud, highlighting a trade-off between privacy and security. Similarly, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act sparked a significant public debate about the balance between privacy and the right to information. However, even in Parliament the government's rationale behind prioritizing privacy over information access was never disclosed and debated, leaving the trade-offs to be examined only in the public sphere.

Pakistan faces similar issues, particularly in balancing national security, transparency, and privacy. Despite having the right to information enshrined in its Constitution, the government\'s actions, such as strengthening the Official Secrets Act (OSA) rather than improving the RTI framework, suggest a prioritization of security over transparency. Additionally, while privacy is recognized as a fundamental right, the absence of a comprehensive privacy or data protection law means that this right is not effectively enforced. The lack of explicit recognition of these trade-offs between transparency, privacy, and security leads to a governance framework that is inconsistent and often prioritizes state control.

In the Philippines, the governance framework implicitly prioritizes data privacy over the free flow of information. This is evident in the country\'s data protection policies, which have been legislated despite the absence of a comprehensive Freedom of Information (FOI) law. The exceptions to the FOI Ordinance, grounded in existing laws and jurisprudence, further emphasize that the assertion of freedom of information is secondary to privacy and other legal limitations. This implicit prioritization reflects a one-sided approach to managing trade-offs, where privacy is clearly valued over transparency.

Sri Lanka's approach to data governance is characterized by sectoral inconsistencies, particularly in the financial and health sectors. The financial sector's regulations do not align fully with the general framework for cross-border data under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), and the health sector's policies are varied and lack a common structure. These inconsistencies suggest that trade-offs between different governance objectives have not been explicitly recognized or managed, leading to fragmented and potentially ineffective governance practices.

In Indonesia, the governance framework is similarly fragmented. Open data initiatives coexist with restrictive laws like the Information and Electronic Transactions (ITE) Law, which grants the government authority to control access to information deemed to disturb public order. Although Indonesia has enacted a Personal Data Protection (PDP) law, its enforcement is weak, and the law itself is not yet fully effective. These indicate a lack of clear recognition of the trade-offs between data openness, control, and privacy, leading to a governance framework that is both inconsistent and inadequately enforced.

Nepal and Thailand further illustrate the challenges of implicit trade-off management in data governance. Nepal's laws are not aligned with international standards like the GDPR, and there has been little recognition of the trade-offs between data privacy, security, and cross-border data flows. Thailand, while providing constitutional guarantees for access to public information, also includes broad exceptions for national security and privacy. These exceptions, supported by laws like the Rules on Maintenance of Official Secrets and the Personal Data Protection Act, demonstrate an implicit trade-off that prioritizes state security over transparency, without an explicit acknowledgment of the consequences.

While each country grapples with balancing privacy, transparency, security, and economic growth, none have explicitly addressed the trade-offs involved. Instead, these trade-offs are managed implicitly, often resulting in inconsistent data governance frameworks.

## Policy learnings

\(iv\) Are there legislative or policy innovations with potential for replication? What are the modalities of sharing experiences? Are developing countries learning from each other, or are they learning from the developed countries?

Countries across this region are engaging in a dynamic process of legislative and policy innovation, with several developments holding potential for replication. For instance, multiple nations have enshrined the Right to Information (RTI) as a constitutional right, providing a robust legal foundation for transparency and accountability. Sri Lanka has been particularly notable in its enforcement of the RTI Act, offering a model that could inspire other countries. India, too, initially demonstrated effective implementation of RTI through active Information Commissions, though it has recently faced challenges due to government neglect. Additionally, India's push for the development of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) focused on interoperability, based on open standards and free/open source software stands out as an innovation worth studying and adapting --- to avoid the errors that India has done, as well as to suit one's own needs. DPI has the potential to greatly improve digital services and governance, if done right.

In Indonesia, the E-Government Presidential Regulation No. 95 of 2018 has established a comprehensive framework for digital governance, exemplified by the creation of national and local open data platforms. These platforms promote transparency and citizen engagement, setting a valuable precedent. Furthermore, Indonesia's Anti-Corruption Law includes provisions that protect whistleblowers, highlighting the importance of safeguarding individuals who expose corruption. The country also mandates public officials, including mayors, governors, and legislators, to disclose their assets, enhancing accountability. Similarly, Thailand\'s Digitalization of Public Administration and Services Delivery Act B.E. 2562 (2019) provides a robust legal and practical framework for data governance in the public sector. This Act empowers the Digital Government Development Agency (DGA) to issue guidelines and announcements that streamline digital governance processes. However, it is also crucial to recognize innovations that should be avoided, such as the practice in Pakistan where a national identity agency sells citizens' data to private parties without their consent.

The sharing of experiences among nations is facilitated through multilateral and international forums. Political groupings and organizations such as IBSA, BRICS, G20, WTO, and various UN platforms serve as crucial avenues for countries to exchange best practices and collaborate on policy development. The Philippines, for instance, has effectively utilized the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to enhance its open data policies, particularly between 2010 and 2016. India, despite not joining the OGP, developed its national open data portal independently, demonstrating alternative pathways for experience sharing and policy development. Regional collaboration also offers opportunities for mutual learning, as seen in Nepal's potential to share and learn from neighboring countries like India, particularly in implementing robust cybersecurity policies.

Developing countries are only seldom learning from each other; they are mainly taking from developed, mostly Western, nations --- rather than, say, Singapore or Japan. Data protection and privacy laws in several countries, including India, the Philippines, and Nepal, have been significantly influenced by frameworks like the European Union's GDPR. Thailand has also incorporated data governance practices inspired by countries such as Australia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. In some instances, developing countries have critically evaluated policies from developed nations, using them as negative examples to chart their own course. For example, India has deliberately diverged from certain aspects of international data protection trends to better suit its own context. However, the evidence of systematic learning among developing countries themselves is less pronounced. The shared challenges and contexts among developing nations present opportunities for increased mutual learning and experience exchange.

We thus see plenty of regional legislative and policy innovation. While multilateral platforms and international partnerships play a significant role in facilitating this exchange, there is still ample room for enhanced collaboration among developing countries. By recognizing and replicating successful initiatives while critically assessing and avoiding detrimental practices, nations can foster progressive and sustainable policy development that is responsive to their unique socio-political contexts.

## Policy development processes

\(v\) How were the laws and bills developed? What expertise was brought to bear? How open were the procedures? How receptive were drafters to suggestions and criticisms?

The development of laws and bills across various countries reflects a diverse range of approaches, characterized by varying degrees of openness, inclusivity, and responsiveness to stakeholder input. In many cases, the process has been criticized for lacking transparency and inclusiveness, though there are notable exceptions where comprehensive consultations have been prioritized.

In South Korea, the revision of data protection laws in 2020 and 2023 serves as an exemplar of an inclusive legislative process. The government engaged in extensive consultations with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including businesses, technologists, civil society organizations, and legal academics. This approach ensured that the law was well-rounded and reflective of the needs and concerns of all parties involved. South Korea's process is a model of how legislative development can be conducted with a high level of openness and receptivity to input.

In India, the legislative process shows a complex interplay between openness and opacity. While there is an official Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy (PLCP) that mandates the publication of draft legislation and encourages public feedback, the implementation of this policy is inconsistent. Some laws, like the data protection legislation, underwent extensive consultations and committee reviews, theoretically aligning with the principles of transparency. However, the final versions of these laws were often pushed through parliament with little regard for the input gathered during consultations, revealing a disconnect between the process and the outcome. Additionally, the involvement of private entities in the development of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India, rather than direct governmental oversight, has raised concerns about transparency and accountability. The opaque nature of these processes, despite the PLCP, contrasts sharply with the more open and inclusive approaches seen elsewhere, such as in South Korea.

Pakistan also exemplifies a more consistent and open approach to legislative development, particularly in the realm of digital policies. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT) in 2000, there has been a sustained practice of public consultations on key policies and laws, including the Personal Data Protection (PDP) draft. The Pakistani process is notable for reflecting a well-established tradition of engaging the public in policymaking.

Since Sri Lanka lacks judicial review, pre-legislative consultations are ever so important. But while many laws, including the Personal Data Protection Act, have had wide-ranging consultations, other laws, such as the Online Safety Act 2024, have been passed with minimal public consultation.

Indonesia exhibits a fragmented and less transparent legislative process. This lack of a consultative approach creates a lack of transparency in legislative processes. While public data is routinely shared through mechanisms like the One Data Indonesia initiative, the legislative process is often used to suppress dissent rather than promote democratic engagement. The ITE Law, for example, has been criticized for weakening democratic practices and being used by politicians to target critics, highlighting the limitations of transparency in Indonesia's legislative framework.

Thailand's experience with the Digitalization of Public Administration and Services Delivery Act (DPASD) offers another perspective on the challenges of legislative openness. While the DPASD mandates the creation of data catalogs and increased public access to information, the actual influence of public opinion on the legislative process remains limited. Despite opportunities for public feedback through government platforms, the final content of the law showed little change from its initial draft, reflecting a broader issue of how public consultations are integrated---or not---into legislative outcomes.

Nepal presents a mixed picture, with structured processes in place for pre-legislative consultation, including public hearings and expert input. However, these processes are often hampered by a lack of expertise, particularly in emerging fields like AI and data governance. The drafting of the AI concept paper, for example, revealed significant gaps in the consultation process, with limited involvement of foreign experts and a general lack of expertise in the field. This contrasts with the more inclusive and expert-driven approaches seen in South Korea and Pakistan.

Overall, the comparison across countries highlights a spectrum of practices in legislative development, ranging from highly inclusive and transparent processes, as seen in South Korea and Pakistan, to more opaque and inconsistent approaches, as in India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The effectiveness of these processes often depends on the extent to which public feedback is genuinely incorporated into final legislation and the degree of transparency maintained throughout the legislative process. Countries that have institutionalized open consultations and ensured that stakeholder input is reflected in the final laws tend to have more robust and democratic legislative outcomes.

## Capacity challenges

\(vi\) How were capacity challenges addressed: by simplifying the laws or by tolerating incomplete implementation?

Capacity challenges in implementing data governance laws manifest differently across various countries, with responses ranging from simplifying legal frameworks to struggling with incomplete implementation due to various constraints.

In India, the data protection law has been simplified by focusing solely on digital personal data, excluding offline data. This approach reduces the complexity of the law, making it more adaptable to Indian conditions. However, by limiting the grounds for processing data and reducing the rights of data subjects compared to more comprehensive frameworks like the GDPR, the law has inadvertently made compliance more challenging for private entities. This trade-off highlights the balancing act between simplifying the law for ease of implementation and the potential difficulties it creates for those who must comply.

Pakistan presents a different scenario where the capacity issue is not just about technical or institutional limitations but also about the political will to execute policies. The country\'s laws, sprinkled with terms like \"national security\" and \"public interest,\" reflect a desire for state control rather than a clear commitment to capacity building. The illusion of a capacity deficit often masks deeper issues, such as the conflicting priorities between attracting investment and maintaining government accountability versus the desire for stronger state control. This tension has resulted in laws that are difficult to enforce effectively, further complicating the state\'s ability to implement them.

In the Philippines, capacity-building efforts are actively supported, often with the help of foreign aid. However, the process of implementing reforms can be slow and cumbersome, particularly when legislative amendments are needed. Instead, reformers frequently explore administrative adjustments, which are more feasible when the relevant agencies have sufficient rule-making power. Despite this, the successful implementation of reforms still requires strong support from the executive branch, including the Office of the President, especially in cases where inter-agency coordination is necessary.

Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand each illustrate how capacity challenges are addressed, though often with mixed results. In Sri Lanka, the Right to Information (RTI) Commission has attempted to simplify certain requirements, like archiving, to ease implementation, but these efforts are not consistent across sectors. Indonesia faces a significant gap in infrastructure and training, with many public institutions unprepared to meet the demands of RTI laws. Only 94 out of 182 institutions have data officers, and even fewer have received the necessary training, leading to widespread non-compliance. Similarly, Thailand struggles with a lack of knowledge, resources, and willingness among government departments to integrate data governance into their operations. The private sector, in turn, follows only the minimum legal requirements, as there are no clear guidelines for effective data governance.

In Nepal, the situation mirrors some of these challenges. Government agencies are open to capacity-building initiatives, often funded by foreign aid, but gaps in the laws, technological infrastructure, and expertise have led to incomplete implementation of data governance laws. The country has seen numerous cases of cybercrime and data breaches that remain unresolved due to a lack of understanding by judges and the absence of the necessary technical tools to address these issues effectively.

Across these countries, capacity challenges are met with a combination of simplifying laws to make them more manageable and tolerating incomplete implementation due to political, institutional, and resource-related constraints. One other option is to focus both laws and enforcement at larger entities (governmental and corporate) which can take on the burden of compliance.
