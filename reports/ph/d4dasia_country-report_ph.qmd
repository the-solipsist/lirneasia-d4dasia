# Executive Summary

**Data Governance in the Philippines**

The Philippine data governance landscape is characterized by the absence of an organized or comprehensive legal policy concerning data flows or governance. Data does not easily fit into the traditional property categories under the 1949 Civil Code, leading to a more casual treatment compared to conventional property. Despite this, recent decades have seen the enactment of relevant policies, such as the Intellectual Property Code and the Data Privacy Act (DPA), and avowed changes in public data management. The Philippines has also endorsed and implemented the Open Government Declaration as a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), and enacted laws like the 2007 National Archives of the Philippines Act and an executive order for freedom of information.

These changes, however, have not resulted in a unitary framework over data; instead, legislation and rulemaking are confined to categories or facets of data, driven by sector-specific concerns like personal data protection or credit information. The 2016 presidential ordinance governing requests for disclosure of government data based on the constitutional right of access to information is the closest the Philippines has to an overarching rule on data governance.

**Policies that Increase Access to Data**

\"Public data\" refers to information gathered, processed, stored, or generated by Philippine public authorities, intended to be machine-readable. The Philippine Constitution mandates transparency and disclosure of government records as a general rule, particularly through Section 7, Article III (right to information on matters of public concern) and Section 28, Article II (full public disclosure of transactions involving public interest). However, these are subject to limitations provided by law.

***Proactive State Policies Increasing Access to Data:***

- OGP: The Philippines, a founding member of OGP since 2011, institutionalized its commitments through Executive Order No. 31 in 2023. Multiple government websites now provide public online access to data.

- Open Data Portal (data.gov.ph): Launched in 2014, this portal serves as a central repository for public sector datasets from (as of the time of writing) 17 government departments and agencies, proactively releasing data such as statistics and key performance indicators.

- Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) OpenSTAT (openstat.psa.gov.ph): PSA, the highest policy-making body on statistical matters, maintains a separate, more comprehensive public access platform for national and sub-national statistics under an open data license. Notably, despite PSA being listed as a contributor to the Open Data Portal, its contributions there are limited to annual reports, highlighting a lack of meaningful linkage between the two platforms.

- National government budget data: The Department of Budget and Management\'s website and the PhilGEPS portal provide public access to budget data, procurement plans, and awarded contracts. All government agencies are also required to maintain a Transparency Seal on their websites, disclosing mandates, officials, budgets, procurement plans, major projects, and financial reports.

- Full disclosure policy portal for local government units (fdpp.dilg.gov.ph): Since 2010, local governments have been required to make financial documents available online, with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) establishing a dedicated portal for this purpose.

- Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI) Datasets: This platform hosts environmental and geospatial data for researchers and forecasters, aiming to enhance disaster management, though some datasets are not publicly available.

- National Archives of the Philippines (NAP): Established by the 1997 National Archives Act, it governs public records with archival value, preserving them and making them available to the public. Records are classified as \"open access\" or \"restricted\" after 30 years, with exceptions for national defense, security, privacy, and investigatory records. Public access remains primarily physical, with limited digitized material.

- Data formats and interoperability standards: The Philippine Electronic Government Interoperability Framework (PeGIF) was approved in 2014 to standardize data exchange. The 2016 Freedom of Information (FOI) Ordinance mandates government offices to maintain accurate records in appropriate formats. The DPA requires personal data controllers, including government, to implement security measures, with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) recommending ISO/IEC 27002 and 27018 standards for government agencies and their service providers.

- Use of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS): There is no official policy mandating FOSS, and proposed legislation has not advanced.

***Reactive Government Policies on Allowing Access:***

- Right to Information Ordinance (Executive Order No. 02, 2016): In the absence of an FOI statute, this EO operationalizes the constitutional right to information within the executive branch. It establishes an administrative procedure for requests, requiring a written submission, assistance to the requester, a response within 15 working days, and an administrative appeal process for denials. An online portal ([[www.foi.gov.ph]{.underline}](http://www.foi.gov.ph)) was launched for this purpose.

- Civil and property records: The 1930 Law on Registry of Civil Status and the 1979 Property Registration Decree designate civil and land registration records as public documents, with access open to the public. A 2022 law mandates the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to develop a civil registry database.

- Land management data: The Land Management Bureau adopted a Land Administration and Management System (LAMS) in 2010 to ensure integrity and access to land information, though public access is not yet operational.

- Corporate and securities records: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates corporations, treating documents like articles of incorporation and annual financial statements as public records, viewable online for a fee via the SEC i-View system.

***Private Sector Mandates Promoting Openness:***

- Competition-related: The 2015 Philippine Competition Act enables the Philippine Competition Commission to access commercial documents related to significant merger and acquisition agreements to ensure compliance with competition laws.

- Credit information records: The 2008 Credit Information System Act (CISA) established a centralized system and created the Credit Information Corporation (CIC) to collect and disseminate credit information to lending institutions. CIC maintains strict confidentiality but allows lending entities and borrowers to access consolidated basic credit data.

***Policies that Decrease Openness***

Restrictions on data flow arise from contract stipulations or legal/regulatory impositions. The 2016 Inventory of Exceptions to Executive Order No. 02 lists broad exceptions to the right of access to information, including executive privilege, national security, law enforcement, privacy protection, and information deemed confidential by official capacity or specific laws (e.g., banking/finance).

***Decreasing Openness to Favor Collective Rights/Common Good:***

- Executive privilege or national security: The Supreme Court recognizes executive privilege for presidential communications and policy formulation, and information related to national security, defense, or international relations. A 1964 Memorandum circular outlines confidentiality classifications for executive documents, each with specific rules on disclosure. The National Archives Act also allows access to be withheld on account of national defense/security, established privilege, investigatory records, and financial institution stability.

- Indigenous data sovereignty: The Constitution and the 1997 Indigenous People\'s Rights Act (IPRA) protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities (IPPs) to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions, and institutions, granting them full ownership and control over their cultural and intellectual rights. Access to biological and genetic resources within ancestral lands requires Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) from these communities.

- Data and collective privacy concerns: The DPA imposes obligations on data controllers, including government agencies, to protect personal data, with non-compliance incurring administrative and criminal penalties. Personal information must only be retained as long as necessary. The DICT\'s Cloud First Policy generally permits no residency restrictions on government data in the cloud but applies restrictions for sensitive data, requiring storage within the Philippines or states with extradition treaties. Data sharing agreements between government agencies or for commercial purposes must be written and include safeguards.

- Disclosures related to money laundering statutes: The 2001 Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) mandates covered persons (financial institutions, designated non-financial professions/businesses) to report covered and suspicious transactions to the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) electronically. Covered institutions must retain transaction records for at least five years, and \"complex\" entities are required to use electronic anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) systems.

- Establishing and maintaining government digitized databases: Recent laws increasingly mandate the collation of specific records into government-maintained databases, reflecting increased digitalization, though not always for public access. Examples include the Philippine Identification System Act (2017) (also known as the PhilSys Act) for a national ID and PhilSys Registry, the Community-Based Monitoring System Act (2018) for localized poverty data, and various law enforcement databases (NBI, Anti-Terrorism Council, anti-trafficking, LTO for motorcycles, AMLC for money laundering transactions).

- SIM card registration information: The 2022 SIM Card Registration Act requires end-users to register their SIMs, but this information is treated as absolutely confidential, accessible to law enforcement only through a duly issued subpoena for crime investigation.

***Decreasing Openness to Favor Individuals:***

- Protection of individual privacy rights: The DPA requires a lawful basis for processing personally identifying information (PII) and guaranteeing data subjects\' rights. PII must be retained only as long as necessary and disposed of securely. The DPA provides exemptions for PII processed for journalistic, artistic, literary, or research purposes (if for public benefit and under strict confidentiality). Other exemptions include information on matters of public concern (e.g., public officials\' functions, discretionary government benefits) and data necessary for public authority functions (e.g., law enforcement). Cross-border data transfers must adhere to DPA principles, ensuring comparable protection. Context-specific laws also impose privacy requirements (e.g., Philippine Statistical Act, SIM Card Registration Act, laws for vulnerable sectors).

- Promoting intellectual property rights: Copyright law protects literary, scholarly, scientific, and artistic works, including compilations of data. Fair-use exceptions permit use for criticism, news reporting, scholarship, research, and decompilation for interoperability. The Intellectual Property Code does not recognize AI-generated works as authors must be natural persons. Trade secrets and undisclosed information are also protected.

***Data Privacy and Security:***

- Online traffic data: The 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act requires service providers to preserve traffic data for at least six months, accessible by law enforcement with a court warrant. The Supreme Court, in *Disini v. Secretary of Justice (2014)*, deemed real-time collection without a warrant unconstitutional due to privacy concerns.

- Data security measures: The DPA mandates appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures for personal data protection by all controllers, including government and private entities. Government agencies are specifically guided by NPC Circular No. 16-01, recommending ISO/IEC 27002 and 27018 standards.

- Private sector mandates: The DICT\'s Memorandum Circular No. 05 (2017) designates certain private sector entities as Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) (e.g., transportation, banking, telecommunications) and requires them to comply with ISO/IEC 27001, participate in security assessments, and establish Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). DICT Circular No. 10 (2020) extends the Cloud First Policy to private cloud service providers dealing with government data, imposing restrictions on data management, use, security, and encryption key control.

- Exceptions to data security for law enforcement: The Constitution allows privacy invasion upon lawful court order or when public safety/order requires it. Specific laws permit interception of computer data with court warrants for cybercrime, terrorism, and online sexual abuse of children. For the latter, undercover operations may proceed without a court order.

**Recommendations Towards Increasing Data Flows**

Despite the absence of a comprehensive data governance law, an existing framework recognizes the importance of information generation, the constitutional right to access, and privacy. However, real-world practices often frustrate data access and sharing. A significant challenge is the absence of a unified/centralized framework for inter-government data sharing and open access. The fragmented nature, evidenced by the lack of integration between the Open Data Portal and the more comprehensive PSA datasets, highlights poor inter-agency coordination. Government agencies often show hesitancy in sharing data, even for FOI requests, providing various justifications. The current FOI Ordinance is deemed insufficient, with calls for a legislated FOI statute to compel effective implementation and to revisit existing exceptions that predate the constitutional right to information. The lack of a clear data sharing mandate within government hinders evidence-based policymaking. Executive action through an Executive Order could mandate inter-agency sharing and revive initiatives like PeGIF, which aimed for common data standards, but this indicates a low priority within the executive branch.

The DPA is also frequently invoked to deny access, sometimes inaccurately, even for non-identifying data or exempted categories. The criminal penalties under the DPA make public officers overly conservative in disclosing information, deterring access even when warranted. Removing these criminal penalties, confining punishments to administrative fines, could lead to more liberal information disclosure by public custodians.

Another critical area for improvement is increasing access to traffic data for law enforcement. The Supreme Court\'s ruling in *Disini v. Secretary of Justice* that made a judicial warrant a requirement for traffic data collection has hampered cybercrime investigations, as traffic data is often the first step in identifying anonymous online criminals. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which the Philippines acceded to in 2018, distinguishes traffic data from content data and subscriber information, requiring \"expeditious disclosures\" of traffic data to identify service providers and communication paths, without necessitating a judicial warrant (only a \"production order\"). The current warrant requirement in the Philippines, which conflates traffic, content, and subscriber data, is seen as burdensome and contrary to the Convention\'s differentiated treatment and call for expediency. Since the Supreme Court has exclusive power to promulgate procedural rules, it could modify existing rules to introduce a subpoena-like process for traffic data, balancing the court\'s concern for individual privacy with the Convention\'s obligations for expedited disclosure. Expediting access to traffic data is deemed a necessity for comprehensive cybercrime investigations.

# Introduction

This report on data governance in Philippines is part of the \"Harnessing Data for Democratic Development in South and Southeast Asia\" (D4DAsia) project, which aims, *inter alia*, to create and mobilize new knowledge about tensions, gaps, and the evolution of the data governance ecosystem taking into account formal and informal policies and practices.

In today\'s digital age, data governance ecosystems play a crucial role in shaping our societies. These ecosystems, comprising policies, laws, practices, behaviors, and technologies, aim to govern data in ways that protect rights, foster innovation, enhance transparency, and ultimately promote democratic and inclusive governance. An ideal data governance system would protect rights, enable innovation, improve transparency, and help in bringing about democratic, inclusive governance. However, the landscape of data governance is complex and often fraught with challenges, particularly in South and Southeast Asia.

Through the rest of the report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term \"policies\" is used as shorthand for policies, statutes, regulations, rules, administrative orders, and even practices and technologies that are used to implement all of those as part of data governance ecosystems.

Data is increasingly being recognized as an enabler for development. It is an essential requirement for policymaking and monitoring of development goals and targets. When effectively managed, data can be used as an asset to support significant development actions such as poverty reduction, food security, mitigating impact of climate change, and disaster management. If mismanaged, it can exacerbate inequalities and undermine the development potential of the same actions.

The D4DAsia project has produced nine reports so far \-\-- seven detailed individual country reports that deal with the issues of data governance in the following countries: India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand; a detailed look at data protection in South Korea; and a synthesis report that summarizes the findings from the various countries while drawing out the contrasts amongst them, along with detailed findings for the research questions we had posed, which are:

1.  What is common, and what is nationally specific, in the emerging data governance architectures in South and Southeast Asia? What are the explanations?

2.  What are the implications of the emergent nature of the governance architecture? Because there is no overall design that envisions how the parts fit together, it is likely that there will be friction points and even contradictions. How are these being worked out?

3.  The emerging governance architecture involves trade-offs among objectives such as greater accountability of powerholders, economic growth, including creation of employment and wealth, resilience of systems, etc. How have different societies: (a) explicitly recognized the trade-offs or not; and (b) handled them?

4.  Are there legislative or policy innovations with potential for replication? What are the modalities of sharing experiences? Are developing countries learning from each other, or are they learning from the developed countries?

5.  How were the laws and bills developed? What expertise was brought to bear? How open were the procedures? How receptive were drafters to suggestions and criticisms?

6.  How were capacity challenges addressed: by simplifying the laws or by tolerating incomplete implementation?

## Structure of the report

### Governance background

This report starts by providing contextual information about the Constitution and governance framework in the Philippines, including how lawmaking powers are distributed and delegated, the powers of the judiciary to overturn laws or to enforce policies, and the legal and regulatory background in the country.

### Increasing openness / access

The report then discusses policies that increase openness or access. By this we mean policies that allow greater access by citizens, consumers, and corporations to data, or facilitate interoperability or cross-border data transfer. Specifically, we do not include increased governmental access to citizens\' private data or non-public corporate data.

This section discusses open data policies, the question of how much governmental data is made available proactively and how much is reactive as well as the quality of data being disseminated. The report also assesses government policies favoring or requiring FOSS or open standards, noting any specific standards that are mandated.

### Decreasing openness / access

The report then moves on to discuss the opposite, i.e., laws, policies and practices that decrease openness or access. By this we mean decreasing access of citizens, consumers, and corporations to data. To be clear, this is not a negative value judgement, since upholding important individual and collective rights, such as privacy and public security, necessitate reducing citizens\' access to data.

This theme explores issues of security such as whether there are any data retention or localization requirements, restrictions on the right to access information (such as national security, privacy, etc.) and exceptions to data security requirements for law enforcement. We further discuss the privacy and copyright framework in brief and specifically try to answer whether there are any exceptions for search engines as well as for research and artificial intelligence (AI).

The last part of the report consists of a deep dive examining the policy gaps and frictions in the data governance framework.

The issue of data governance and the policies surrounding its implementation is a critical one for governments, citizens, and businesses across the world. As mentioned earlier, we use the term data governance to refer to \"diverse arrangements, including technical, policy, regulatory or institutional provisions, that affect data and their creation, collection, storage, use, protection, access, sharing and deletion across policy domains and organisational and national borders\"[@oecdGoingDigitalGuide2022].

# Overview of the Philippine Data Governance Landscape

The Philippines does not have an organized or a comprehensive legal policy concerning data flows or data governance. Data does not easily fit into the categories of property under the 1949 Civil Code, which distinguishes only between real and personal property and further categorizes personal property as generally tangible objects [@CivilCodePhilippines1949]. The absence of unequivocal proprietary rights over data has resulted in a more casual treatment of data as objects, in a manner that differs from the more deliberate approach to more conventional types of property where the legal ties that bind are more certain.

However, recent decades have seen the enactment of relevant data governance policies that are more responsive to the increased uses and flows of data in the private and public sector. For example, the evolution of international agreements on intellectual property protection have led to an intellectual property code more cognizant of international practices and increased digitalization; the increased cross-border processing of personal information has led to a Philippine law for the protection of personal data. Meanwhile, there have been significant changes also as to the management and governance of public data generated by the government or acquired in the exercise of governmental functions. The Philippines has endorsed and implemented, to some extent, the Open Government Declaration, which relates to the promotion of \"transparent, participatory, inclusive and accountable governance,\" as a member of the OGP \[@OGPAbout2023\][@OpenGovernmentDeclaration2011]. Other developments include the enactment of the 2007 National Archives of the Philippines Act and an executive order implementing the constitutional right to freedom of information [@NationalArchivesPhilippines2007].

However, these changes have not resulted in, or do not imply the existence of, a unitary framework policy on data governance. The closest thing to an overarching rule is the 2016 presidential ordinance governing requests for disclosure of government data in accordance with the constitutional right of access to information. Otherwise, the individual legislation or rule making that has emerged is confined to particular categories or facets of data, animated by sector-specific concerns such as personal data protection or credit information.

This study shall detail the different policies, whether enacted by Congress through statutes or by the President (often through Executive Orders) and the various administrative agencies through their delegated rule-making powers, governing the administration and transfer of data, whether in the control of the private or public sector, and whatever its character or utility may be.

### Policies that Increase Access to Data

\"Public data,\" for purposes of this study, refers to data that is either gathered, processed, stored, or generated by public authorities of the Republic of the Philippines. \"Data\" is further qualified as information that is machine readable. Public data is distinguished from \"privately held data,\" which refers to such information held or owned by the private sector, but whose uses may nonetheless be regulated by the government.

When it comes to public data, the Philippines has fundamental policies as ordained under the Philippine Constitution that mandate transparency and disclosure of government records and data as the general rule, even as the Constitution itself accommodates the possibility of legislated exceptions [@ConstitutionRepublicPhilippines1987]. The Bill of Rights, particularly Section 7, Article III of the Constitution, guarantees the right of the people to information on matters of public concern; however the same provision states that people\'s access to official records, to government research data used as the basis for policy development, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, may be subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.

In a similar vein, while Section 28, Article II declares the adoption and implementation of a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest as state policy, it is still subject \"to reasonable conditions prescribed by law.\"

Since the adoption of the Philippine Constitution in 1987, no law has been passed by Congress establishing a mechanism for explicitly implementing the constitutional right to access information ostensibly guaranteed by the constitutional provisions. There are statutes such as the 2007 National Archives Act that nonetheless govern the management and administration of public records, with a thrust of ensuring their preservation [@NationalArchivesPhilippines2007].

In 2016, an Executive Order (\"FOI Ordinance\") issued by the President of the Philippines established an administrative procedure within the executive branch of government for reviewing and granting requests for access to government records and documents [@InstitutionalizingPhilippineOpen2023].[^1] This mechanism is powered through an online portal and created a greater public expectation that citizens may request government documents and data online. The FOI Ordinance, however, has not deterred government agencies from withholding information that ostensibly does not fall within the prescribed exceptions from disclosure.

In addition, there are different statutes and administrative rules that enable access by the public of certain types of publicly and privately held data that, owing to public interest or pursuant to any public purpose, has been required to be submitted to a specific government agency or instrumentality and/or disclosed to the public.

#### Proactive State Policies Increasing Access to Data/Content

The Philippine Constitution, particularly Article II, Section 28, requires that the \"State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest \[s\]ubject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law\" [@ConstitutionRepublicPhilippines1987]. However, this provision, unlike Article III, Section 7, falls within the general declarations of state policies that, under Philippine jurisprudence, generally, are not by themselves the source of legal rights or obligations that are enforceable by the courts. Still, the constitutionally ordained policies are expected to guide legislators and policymakers in crafting rules and regulations. And in recent years, government transparency has indeed become part of the public-facing aspects of state governance, especially with the emergence of the internet space as a portal for interaction between the government and the governed.

Article II, Section 28 provides sufficient legal guidance to the Philippine government as it determines its specific policies on public disclosure of government-held data. While it could also be invoked as the basis for disclosure by the government of unreleased data through an adversarial proceeding, it is preferable to obtain the data without having to resort to such a contentious process.

Even before the internet era, there was already an established doctrine that mandated the non-discretionary publication in either the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation of all statutes, and of all administrative rules and regulations if their purpose is to enforce or implement existing law pursuant also to a valid delegation [@TanadaTuvera1986]. Further, the 1987 Administrative Code also required that every rule promulgated by an administrative agency be filed with the University of the Philippines Law Center as a condition for such rule becoming the basis for any sanction against any party or persons [@InstitutingAdministrativeCode1987]. The compulsory force of these holdings does not extend to such government information/data that is not in the form of a rule or regulation. However, the constitutional policy of transparency, coupled with the emergence of the internet as a public-facing communication platform at the disposal of the government, has resulted in the pro-active voluntary release of a considerable volume of government data.

A mandated policy of government disclosure also necessarily requires a policy of preservation of such covered data. The recent advent of data privacy policies, with their emphasis on limited data sharing and retention dictated strictly by need, may have driven holders of government data towards lesser access [@NPCPCOOWork2020].

##### Open Government Data under Auspices of Open Government Partnership

The Philippines is among the eight founding members of OGP, a broad international coalition of 75 countries formed in 2011 that aims to promote increased access to information and disclosure about governmental activities at every level of government [@OpenGovernmentDeclaration2011].[^2] In June 2023, the Philippines\' government institutionalized its commitments under OGP through the promulgation of Executive Order No. 31, which established a Steering Committee that sets the direction, programs and activities of PH-OGP [@InstitutionalizingPhilippineOpen2023]. The Executive Order also committed to the establishment of a national action plan to formulate programs and policies that conform to the OGP\'s values.

At present, there are several government websites maintained by different agencies that enable public online access to government data, consistent with the OGP\'s mission.

##### Open Data Portal (data.gov.ph)

In 2014, the Philippine government launched the Open Data Portal ([[\[www.data.gov.ph\]{.underline}]{.underline}](http://www.data.gov.ph/)) as part of the government\'s program to proactively release public sector datasets and generate an ecosystem for its use by the public. The portal serves as a repository for open datasets from various Philippine government agencies. The data available on the portal pertains to the results of their operations, projects, and the performance of their respective mandates such as statistics and key performance indicators. The portal is maintained by the DICT, with policy direction overseen by an Open Data Task Force consisting of 10 government agencies.

At present, 17 government departments and agencies contribute to the Open Data Portal. This includes cabinet-level departments such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Foreign Affairs, Health, Information and Communications Technology, Labor and Employment, and Transportation, and law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. PSA is also listed as a contributor to the Open Data Portal, even though it also maintains a separate open data platform for the statistical data that it collates.

##### Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) OpenSTAT (openstat.psa.gov.ph)

The PSA was established in 2013 through the 2013 Philippine Statistical Act [@PhilippineStatisticalAct2013]. The PSA is the highest policy-making body on statistical matters. As such, it is primarily responsible for all national censuses and surveys, sectoral statistics, consolidation of selected administrative recording systems, and compilation of national accounts. The PSA is required to collect, compile, analyze, abstract, and publish statistical information relating to the country\'s economic, social, demographic, political affairs and general activities and condition of the people. The PSA was also tasked in 2017 as the primary implementing agency to carry out the 2017 Philippine Identification System Act, the law that established a single national identification system for all citizens and resident aliens of the Philippines [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018].

The PSA is required further to collaborate with departments of the national government in the collection, compilation, maintenance, and publication of statistical information, including special statistical data derived from the activities of those departments, corporations, and their subsidiaries. Another relevant duty of the PSA is to promote and develop integrated social and economic statistics and coordinate plans for the integration of those statistics, including the national accounts. While these mandates clearly align with the purpose of the Open Data initiative, the PSA does not appear to be actively involved with that initiative, especially in a public-facing manner. Instead, it maintains a separate public access online platform known as OpenStat [@PSAOpenSTAT], which contains the statistics generated and compiled by the PSA at the national and sub-national levels, organized into three major domains \-- demographics and social statistics, economic statistics, and environment and multi-domain statistics.

The data in the OpenStat platform is available under an open data license which allows for the use of the data without restrictions save for proper source attribution. The data made available online by the PSA includes summarized and/or aggregated data, as well as microdata that is available on a separate webpage [@PSADAHome].

A review of the PSA\'s OpenStat platform reveals that the included datasets are more comprehensive and more substantive than those that are available on the Open Data Portal. Owing to the agency\'s statutory mandate that requires it to focus on data gathering and analysis, it is not surprising that the management of the OpenStat platform is more professional as compared to the Open Data Portal. The Open Data Portal unfortunately has proven thus far unable to take advantage or make any meaningful linkages to the PSA database. As earlier mentioned, the PSA is listed under the Open Data website as among the agencies that have contributed datasets to that portal. However, an examination of the actual dataset reveals that the PSA contribution is limited to the PSA\'s annual reports from 2012 to 2021, reports which are all also available on the PSA website. These annual reports are glossy publications that almost exclusively focus on the PSA\'s activities and accomplishments for the given year, as opposed to a compilation of data actually gathered and processed by the agency. Any reference to actual statistical data in these reports consists of a few pages of infographics that highlight some data of general public interest, such as birth, death and marriage statistics.

##### National Government Budget Data ([[www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/budget]{.underline}](http://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/budget))

Philippine government national budget data is publicly available through the Department of Budget and Management\'s official website ([*[\[www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/budget\]{.underline}]{.underline}*](http://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/budget)). The website also includes documents related to public bidding and procurement plans. Government procurement is controlled by the Government Procurement Reform Act, which requires a single online portal (known as PhilGEPS) serving as the primary source on all government procurement, and the facility by which all government entities are to procure common supplies [@GovernmentProcurementReform2003].

All agencies of the Philippine government are also required to maintain a Transparency Seal posted in their websites which contain the following data:

- the agency\'s mandates and functions, names of its officials with their position and designation, and contact information;

- approved budgets and corresponding targets, including any modifications made;

- annual procurement plan/s and awarded contracts;

- major activities or projects and their target beneficiaries;

- status of implementation, evaluation or assessment reports of the agency\'s programs or projects;

- the agency\'s budget and financial accountability reports;

- the agency\'s FOI manual signed; and

- annual reports on the status of income authorized by law to be retained or used and be deposited outside of the National Treasury [@GeneralAppropriationsAct2021].

Thus, even if an agency\'s budget data is not part of the larger datasets under the Open Data Portal, such information is required to be available in the agency\'s own website.

##### Full Disclosure Policy Portal for Local Government Units (fdpp.dilg.gov.ph)

Local Government Units of the Philippines were, under the 1991 Local Government Code, specifically required to post a summary of all revenues collected and funds received including the appropriations and disbursement of such funds during the fiscal year [@LocalGovernmentCode1991].[^3] The summary had to be posted within 30 days from the end of each fiscal year in at least three publicly accessible and conspicuous places in the local government unit. In 2010, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) required local governments to make available online, whether through their own websites or through the website of the department, financial documents including annual budgets, cash flows, fund utilization and bidding information [@FullDisclosureLocal2010]. DILG has likewise established a Full Disclosure Policy Portal (fdpp.dilg.gov.ph) where such local government information may be accessed [@FullDisclosureLocal2010].

##### Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI) Datasets (asti.dost.gov.ph/coare/datasets)

ASTI, an institute under the Department of Science and Technology, hosts a platform that serves as a repository for environmental and geospatial data, available to researchers, meteorologists, weather forecasters, and students, with a stated goal of providing enhanced policy and decision making for disaster management. Access to the datasets is free, but some of the uploaded datasets are not made available to the public. There are 14 datasets currently available on the platform, including storm surge hazard maps, landslide hazard maps, and a drought situation map. The storm surge and landslide maps were created by the University of the Philippines through its own Project NOAH initiative and are likewise available through its own website hosted by the university.[^4]

##### National Archives of the Philippines (NAP)

The 1997 National Archives Act governs all public records with archival value, as well as archival and records management programs and activities in all branches of government [@NationalArchivesPhilippines2007].[^5] The law established the NAP, where public archives are stored, preserved, conserved and made available to the public [@NationalArchivesPhilippines2007].[^6] Archives refer to public records, papers, periodicals, books or other materials, whether electronic, audio-visual, or print, which by their nature and characteristics have enduring value and have been selected for permanent preservation.

Under the Act, when public records have been in existence for 30 years or more, or are about to be transferred to the control of NAP\'s executive director, the records are to be classified as either \"open access\" or \"restricted\" by the government agency that had been in control of the records. The classification of such records as \"restricted access\" is premised on either the existence of a legal impediment to their disclosure, or there being a standard or advice issued by the NAP executive director that requires such public records be withheld from public access.

The 2009 Implementing Rules to the National Archives Act provides that the NAP shall provide official information, records, or documents to any requesting public, subject to the following exceptions:

- national defense or security matters;

- documents that place the life and safety of an individual in imminent danger;

- documents falling within the concept of established privilege, as may be established by law or jurisprudence;

- drafts of decisions, orders, rulings, policies, decisions, memoranda, and like documents;

- investigatory records that interfere with enforcement proceedings, deprive one a right to fair trial or adjudication, disclose the identity of a confidential source, or unjustifiably disclose investigative techniques and procedures; and

- information whose premature disclosure endangers the stability of a financial institution or frustrates the implementation of a proposed official action.

The NAP is further required to protect the right to privacy of individuals, groups and organizations, including records, protocols, and policies against indiscriminate usage.

The primary role of the National Archives Act in data governance is in ensuring the administration of preserved government records. The website of NAP is not a portal that enables public access to archival material; it does not contain a general repository of digitized archival material even as it informs the public of the list of collections it maintains. Public access to archival material is still primarily through physical access, thus ensuring that while data is accessible, it is not in a format or through a mechanism that promotes its widespread dissemination. Nonetheless, the website highlights certain archival material from the era of Spanish colonization that has been digitized; it is conceivable that the amount of digitized archival material will increase in the future. However, no specific prescribed policies for the digitalization of such materials or the enabling of wider public access have been released by NAP.

##### Data Formats and Interoperability Standards

In 2014, the Information and Communications Technology Office of the Department of Science and Technology issued circulars approving PeGIF Version 1.0 for implementation by government agencies. PeGIF was intended to define the common knowledge, principles, and standards that national government agencies were to use in the design of data and information systems to enable data exchange and reuse across agencies [@ApprovalPhilippineElectronic2014].[^7] PeGIF promised to implement specifications that comply with the definition of open standards, contribute to open systems, and are relevant to systems\' interconnectivity, data integration, presentation and interface, e-services access, and content management metadata [@InteroperabilityStandards2021].

A succeeding ICTO-DOST circular pertained to information interoperability, defined as \"the ability to transfer and use information in a uniform and effective manner across multiple organizations and information technology systems\... ensuring that organizations share a common understanding and meaning for information that is shared across different IT systems\" [@ApprovalPhilippineElectronic2015]. The circular states that information interoperability is achieved reliably through the use of controlled terminologies, and controlled mapping-tables and mapping-rules for any transformation. Among the stated operating principles in the circular are the use by government of a common language and standardized approach to information exchange, and the use of whole-of-government tools to ensure consistency in information management practices and the improvement of agencies\' ability to reuse information.

The responsibility for implementing PeGIF was assigned to the ICTO-DOST, with its Deputy Executive Director for eGovernment to take the lead in the adoption of standard definitions and formats for information sharing, and the production of information interoperability assets.

In 2015, the ICTO-DOST was abolished by the law creating DICT, with its functions and powers transferred to the new executive department [@ActCreatingDepartment2016]. DICT then became the executive department tasked as the primary policy and implementing entity in developing the national ICT agenda [@ActCreatingDepartment2016].[^8]

Although the ICTO-DOST was abolished, the PeGIF circulars remain in force; the DICT has not formally repealed them. However, the DICT has made no visible effort to implement PeGIF or carry out the tasks set out in the circulars, such as creating standard definitions and formats for information sharing.

In a broadly similar vein, Section 14 of Executive Order No. 02 (\"2016 FOI Ordinance\") mandates government offices to create and/or maintain accurate and reasonably complete records of important information in appropriate formats, and implement a records management system that facilitates easy identification, retrieval and communication of information to the public [@OperationalizingExecutiveBranch2016a],[^9] as a means to operationalize the constitutional right to information and state policies to ensure full public disclosure and transparency in the public service [@OperationalizingExecutiveBranch2016a].[^10]

The DPA requires personal data controllers, including the government, to implement reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures intended for the protection of personal data. For government agencies that control the processing of personal information, the NPC has issued NPC Circular No. 16-01 governing security of personal data in government agencies. Section 6 of the circular recommends the use of the ISO/IEC 27002 control set as the minimum standard to assess any gaps in the agency\'s control framework.[^11] Section 12 of the circular states that the commission recommends ISO/IEC 27018 as the most appropriate certification for the service or function provided by a service provider that is engaged either for the storage of data or as a personal information processor acting under the control of the agency [@ISOIEC27018].[^12]

##### Use of Free and Open-Source Software

There is no official policy requiring the use of FOSS by the government. Legislations that seek to require the use and adoption of FOSS by the government have been filed with the Congress in the past, but no such bills are being deliberated upon by the current Congress. The proposed blueprint for a harmonized government information system developed under the previous Duterte administration, known as the e-Government Masterplan, acknowledged that the framework for \"e-Government systems and applications\" includes \"encouraging an open-source software development framework\"; however, this has not been translated into definite rules or policy regulations issued under the current administration [@EGovernmentMasterplan20222019].

#### Reactive Government Policies on Allowing Access

The proactive data disclosure policies thus far adopted by the Philippine government rely on the sole discretion of the government as to what government data should be made available. Still, such proactive policies should be seen in conjunction with more reactive policies that enable the release of government information upon legal demand.

While proactive policies in the Philippines have a constitutional foundation in the state policy of transparency, reactive policies also draw upon the Constitution as their foundation, but this time through the Bill of Rights (Article III), particularly Section 7, which as mentioned earlier, guarantees citizens, \"access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development\" though subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.

This right to access information on matters of public concern is guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution and is enforceable against the State, albeit subject to statutory and jurisprudential limitations. Several provisions of the Philippine Constitution recognize and facilitate access to information. The most potent of these provisions is located in the Bill of Rights (Article III), Section 7 as stated above, which also explicitly recognizes \"\[t\]he right of the people to information on matters of public concern.\"

##### Right to Information Ordinance

The constitutional right to access information on matters of public concern is, as indicated in Article III, Section 7, also subject to limitations as may be provided by law. However, the ability of Congress to impose limitations by law does not impair the enforceability of the right before Philippine courts. The Philippine Supreme Court has affirmed the provision as the basis for requiring the disclosure of information pertaining to government housing loans extended to members of the legislature [@RicardoValmonteFeliciano1989], about successful bidders in public infrastructure projects [@InitiativeDialogueEmpowerment2012], and details about the equipment and devices to be used in automated national elections [@TeofistoGuingonaJr2010]. It has been the basis for the Philippine Supreme Court to enjoin the President from barring executive officials from giving testimony before legislative committees [@SenatePhilippinesEduardo2006].

The Philippine legislature has yet to enact a statute that would administer the right to information specified under Article III, Section 7 \-- thus there are no legislative dictates that clarify the procedures for or limitations on how an individual may invoke the right. While the absence of such a FOI law does not deter the judicial enforcement of the right, it results in the efficacy of the right being greatly dependent on executive discretion, as well as the motivation of potential litigants, especially since a resort to the courts entails a potentially laborious and adversarial process that hardly facilitates access.

Nonetheless, in 2016, the Philippine government enacted Executive Order No. 02 (\"2016 FOI Ordinance\") with the intention of operationalizing within the executive branch the constitutional right to information, the President doing so in his capacity as the administrative head of the executive [@OperationalizingExecutiveBranch2016a]. In the absence of an FOI statute, Executive Order No. 02 is the most important Philippine ordinance concerning the right to information. It establishes an administrative procedure for the filing and processing of requests for access to information, public records, and official records. The procedure, detailed in Section 9, is as follows:

- A written request is submitted to the government office concerned, containing the name and contact information of the requesting party, valid proof of identification or authorization, a reasonably specific description of the information requested, and the reason for, or purpose of, the request for information

- The public official receiving the request shall provide reasonable assistance, free of charge, to enable all requesting parties and particularly those with special needs, to satisfy their request.

- The government office shall respond to a request as soon as practicable but not exceeding 15 working days from receipt thereof. The response mentioned above refers to the decision of the agency or office concerned to grant or deny access to the information requested. The period to respond may be extended whenever the information requested requires extensive search of the government office\'s records facilities or examination of voluminous records.

- Once a decision is made to grant the request, the person making the request shall be notified of such decision and directed to pay any applicable fees for reimbursement of necessary costs, including actual costs of reproduction and copying of the information required.

- Denials of access requests may be appealed within the administrative branch, a process which generally extends up to final administrative review by the Office of the President. Only upon the exhaustion of administrative appeal remedies may the requesting party file an appropriate case with the proper courts.

Significantly, even though the Executive Order was silent as to the utilization of the internet in dealing with requests for information (and indeed refers to an offline process), the government launched an online portal through which such requests can be submitted and documents released in November 2016 [@ranadaDuterteGovtLaunches2016]. The portal is available at [[\[www.foi.gov.ph\]{.underline}]{.underline}](http://www.foi.gov.ph/). As of September 2023, a total of 185,727 eFOI requests were lodged through the portal, of which 112,769 were tagged as successful.

Executive Order No. 02 likewise directed every government office to prepare their own People\'s FOI Manual, which publicly identifies, among others, the procedure for filing of access to information requests, the person or office responsible for receiving requests, and the process for the disposition of the requests. In compliance, Philippine government offices have their own individual FOI Manuals. As a result, every government agency has their own ordained procedure for handling requests for access to information within their control.

##### Civil and Property Records

The 1930 Law on Registry of Civil Status (Act No. 3753) remains the basic law governing the civil register that records the civil status of persons, including births, deaths, marriages, and changes of name, all of which must be recorded with the local civil registrar [@LawRegistryCivil1930]. Such registration requirements are also reiterated in Articles 407 and 408 of the 1949 Civil Code [@CivilCodePhilippines1949]. Every city and municipality has their own local civil registrar who keeps their own books that record the civil status of persons. The books making up the civil register and all documents relating thereto are considered public documents, access to which is required to be open to the public during office hours. Certified copies of such documents may be issued by the local registrar, or by the PSA. Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 11909 in 2022, DICT was mandated to develop a civil registry database and virtual viewing facility that would allow the easier verification of the authenticity of such civil registry records [@PermanentValidityCertificates2022].

The registration of private land ownership is currently governed by the 1979 Property Registration Decree, which mandates the registration of certificates of title confirming land ownership, with the issuance of such certificates the function of Registers of Deed in every province and city [@PropertyRegistrationDecree1978]. The office of the Register of Deeds is a public repository of records of instruments such as deeds of absolute sale affecting registered or unregistered lands, with such instruments required to be registered with the Register of Deeds. Section 56 of the Property Registration Decree provides that all records and papers relative to registered and (including such private instruments of transfer) be \"open to the public in the same manner as court records, subject to such reasonable regulations as the Register of Deeds may prescribe.\" In practice, each individual Register of Deeds is functionally able to act with a high degree of autonomy in prescribing regulations for their respective offices, resulting in varied practices across provinces and cities.

##### Land Management Data

The Philippines\' Land Management Bureau adopted LAMS in 2010 [@ImprovingManagementLand2010]. LAMS is an \"enhanced land record management facility that ensures integrity of and access to land information such as cadastral maps, isolated survey plans, public land applications, \[and\] patents and titles\" [@ImprovingManagementLand2010].[^13] The issuance which formalizes the adoption of the system adheres to the policy that the Land Management Bureau shall ensure maximum access to land information by both the government and the public [@ImprovingManagementLand2010].[^14] Notably, while LAMS is operational within the various offices of the Land Management Bureau, with access granted to the various Registers of Deed in cities and municipalities, the promised access to the public has yet to be operationalized.

##### Corporate and Securities Records

The 2019 Revised Corporation Code currently provides for the regulatory jurisdiction of SEC over all corporations [@RevisedCorporationCode2019]. The SEC oversees the registration of a corporation and is also the body to which the reporting requirements of corporations required under the Code are to be submitted. The Code requires the annual submission by every corporation doing business in the Philippines, whether domestic or foreign, of annual financial statements and a general information sheet. SEC treats a corporation\'s articles of incorporation, by-laws, and related documents as public records, which are available to the public [@SECPrivacyPolicy]. The SEC has an online viewing system, the SEC i-View, which allows the public to view and print such company reports for a fee [@SECIView].

#### Private Sector Mandates Promoting Openness

Legislation or administrative rules have also, on occasion, resulted in regulations that would require the submission to government agencies of private documents with the intention of making such documents or data generated therefrom accessible to authorized persons, whether in the government or even in the private sector.

##### Competition-related \-- Open Marketplaces

The enforcement of Philippine competition law, particularly the 2015 Philippine Competition Act, enables the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to gain access to certain commercial documents and records relevant to merger or acquisition agreements where the value of the transaction exceeds one billion pesos (P1,000,000,000)[@PhilippineCompetitionAct2015]. These agreements cannot be concluded by the parties until 30 days after providing notification to the PCC in the form and with information on the transaction together with documents such as copies of the preliminary agreement, non-compete agreements, studies and reports related to the transaction, and confidential information memoranda, banker\'s books and third-party documents [@PhilippineCompetitionAct2015].[^15] This requirement is in line with PCC\'s mandate to review proposed mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they do not violate Philippine competition laws [@PhilippineCompetitionAct2015].[^16]

##### Transparency-oriented \-- Credit Information Records

Through CISA, the Philippines established \"a comprehensive and centralized credit information system for the collection and dissemination of fair and accurate information relevant to, or arising from, credit and credit-related activities of all entities participating in the financial system\" [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^17] This enables lending institutions such as banks to more comprehensively assess the credit-worthiness of a prospective borrower through the borrower\'s basic credit data, or the \"positive and negative information provided by a borrower \[in\] connection with the application for and availment of a credit facility and any information on the borrower\'s creditworthiness in the possession of the submitting entity and other factual and objective information related or relevant thereto in the submitting entity\'s data files or that of other sources of information\" [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^18] The specific information used to assess a borrower\'s basic credit data is listed in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the CISA [@ImplementingRulesRegulationCISA2009] [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^19]

CISA established a state-owned corporation, CIC, with the mandate to receive and consolidate basic credit data, act as the central repository of credit information and provide access to reliable, standardized information on credit history and financial condition of borrowers [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^20] Under current procedures, CIC requires the lending institutions to collect the information comprising the basic credit data from the borrower itself, with CIC then processing the data into the basic form. Entities involved in the process, including CIC, submitting entities[^21] and those with access to information are required to hold credit information under strict confidentiality [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^22] Meanwhile, CIC is authorized to release and disclose consolidated basic credit data only to specific entities[^23] such as accessing entities,[^24] special accessing entities,[^25] outsource entities[^26] and borrowers [@CreditInformationSystem2008].[^27] The borrower, by having access to the consolidated basic credit data, can dispute the assessment given to it.

The researchers interviewed the current Executive Director of CISA[^28], who has confirmed the implementation of the current processes as CISA is authorized to undertake under the law and implementing rules. Additionally, he explained that he had expressed his willingness to make financial data available for analysis to other government financial authorities for the implementation of their own mandates, subject to the anonymization of irrelevant personally identifying data.

### Policies that Decrease Openness

Data flow restrictions could arise through private contract stipulations (such as confidentiality agreements), or through impositions prescribed by regulations. This next section focuses on the latter scenario \-- restrictions that arise by operation of law.

The Office of the President in 2016 provided for a summary of the exceptions to the right of access to information as recognized by the Constitution, existing laws, or jurisprudence. These exceptions, broadly, are:

i\. Information covered by executive privilege;

ii\. Privileged information relating to national security, defense, or international relations;

iii\. Information concerning law enforcement and protection of public and personal safety;

iv\. Information deemed confidential for the protection of privacy of certain individuals such as minors, victims of crimes or the accused;

v\. Information, documents, or records known by reason of official capacity and deemed as confidential, including those submitted or disclosed by entities to government agencies, tribunals and boards or officers, in relation to the performance of their functions or to inquires or investigation conducted by them in the exercise of their administrative, regulatory or quasi-judicial powers;

vi\. Prejudicial, premature disclosure;

vii\. Records of proceedings or information from proceedings, which, pursuant to law or relevant rules and regulations, are treated as confidential or privileged;

viii\. Matters considered confidential under banking and finance laws and their amendatory laws, and;

ix\. Other exceptions to the right to information under laws, jurisprudence, and rules and regulations.

The above-mentioned exceptions are listed in a Memorandum from the Executive Secretary dated 24 November 2016, also known as Inventory of Exceptions to Executive Order No. 2 (S. 2016) [@InventoryExceptionsExecutive2016]. Executive Order No. 2, or the FOI Ordinance, had directed the preparation of an inventory of exceptions to access to information based on such exceptions \"enshrined in the Constitution, existing law or jurisprudence.\" The justifications for such exceptions align with categories of favoring collective rights or the common good, and those required for the protection of individual rights. Whatever the justification is the enforceability of such restrictions to information access requires an underlying law or regulation enacted by Congress or executive agencies, or a judicial doctrine pronounced by the Supreme Court, judicial decisions in the Philippines applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution forming a part of the legal system of the Philippines [@CivilCodePhilippines1949]. Thus, the government stands at risk of violating laws and incurring legal liability in exercising discretion in making data available in defiance of these exceptions as legislated or as judicially defined.

#### Decreasing Openness to Favor Collective Rights/ Common Good

##### Justified by Executive Privilege/National Security

The Philippine Supreme Court has recognized the doctrine of executive privilege that allows for certain government information to be withheld from public disclosure. Such information may not be disclosed even upon the issuance of a subpoena by a judicial or legislative body. The President of the Philippines and their close advisors may withhold information about presidential conversations, correspondence, discussions in closed-door meetings, and information and records comprising part of a process by which government decisions and policies are formulated, including drafts of decisions, orders, rulings, and policy decisions.

The Philippine Supreme Court has also recognized that information may also be protected from disclosure if these relate to national security, defense, or international relations. Diplomatic negotiations and other information required to be kept secret in the conduct of foreign affairs falls within this category. Information, records, or documents classified as \"secret\" in the interest of national security are also exempted from disclosure.

The governing regulation for the classification of executive documents and records as \"secret\" is a 1964 Memorandum Circular issued by the Office of the President [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964]. Under the circular, official matters requiring protection in the interest of national security are limited to four categories of classification, each with its own level of accessibility [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].

- **\"Top Secret\"** matters (i.e., the unauthorized disclosure of which would cause exceptionally grave damage to the nation, politically, economically, or from a security aspect) may only be copied, extracted, or reproduced when the classifying authority (i.e., the Head of the Department) has authorized such action [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^29] Top secret matters are not allowed to be transmitted by mail, express or electrical means, unless in cryptographic form [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^30]

- **\"Secret\"** matters (i.e., the unauthorized disclosure of which would endanger national security, cause serious injury to the interest or prestige of the nation or of any governmental activity, or would be of great damage to a foreign nation), limitations on whose reproduction are similar to those on top secret matters [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^31]

- **\"Confidential\"** matters (i.e., the unauthorized disclosure of which, while not endangering national security, would be prejudicial to the interest or prestige of the nation or any government activity, or would cause administrative embarrassment or unwarranted injury to an individual or would be of advantage to a foreign nation), whose reproduction is generally authorized, except when the originator or a higher authority has specifically denied it [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^32]

- **\"Restricted\"** matters (i.e., those which require special protection other than that determined to be Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential), whose reproduction is authorized [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^33] In this regard, government personnel are prohibited from keeping a private record containing statements of facts or opinions, either official or personal, concerning matters which are related to or which affect national interest or security [@PromulgatingRulesGoverning1964].[^34]

As earlier noted, under the National Archives Act, NAP does not grant access to official information, records or documents to the requesting public for, among others: (1) national defense or security matters; established privilege matters; (3) investigatory records; (4) matters that endanger the stability of financial institutions [@RulesRegulationsGoverning2009].[^35] Such determination, under that law, are made by the Executive Director of the National Archives.

Philippine laws also criminalize certain acts of dissemination of information such as espionage, correspondence with a hostile country during times of war, and some disloyal acts or works in time of peace (e.g., distribution of information which advises or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty).[^36]

##### Justified by Indigenous Data Sovereignty

The Philippine Constitution recognizes, respects, and protects the rights of indigenous cultural communities to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions and institutions [@ConstitutionRepublicPhilippines1987].[^37] The principal law governing indigenous people\'s rights is the 1997 Indigenous People\'s Rights Act, a law that entitles indigenous peoples of the Philippines[^38] (IPPs) to full ownership and control over their cultural and intellectual rights[^39] in communal fashion, such community intellectual rights forming part of their right to cultural integrity, which they have the right to own, control, develop and protect \[@IndigenousPeoplesRights1997\][@ImplementingRulesRegulations1998].

The said law recognizes the inherent rights of IPPs to self-governance and self-determination with regard to their values, practices and institutions [@ImplementingRulesRegulations1998].[^40] To operationalize the state policy to respect, recognize, and protect the right of IPPs to preserve and protect their culture, traditions and institutions, the law establishes that IPPs have the right to practice and revitalize their own cultural traditions and customs, as well as the right to restitution of cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free and prior informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs [@ImplementingRulesRegulations1998]. Having full ownership and control over their cultural and intellectual rights, IPPs have the right to special measures to control, develop and protect their sciences, technologies and cultural manifestations, including derivatives of these resources [@ImplementingRulesRegulations1998]. With regard to biological and genetic resources, access is allowed within ancestral lands and domains of the Indigenous Cultural Communities/IPPs only with the free and prior informed consent of such communities [@ImplementingRulesRegulations1998].[^41]

The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), in conjunction with the Intellectual Property Office, issued rules and regulations on intellectual property rights application and registration protecting the indigenous knowledge systems and practices of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPPs)[@RulesRegulationsIntellectual2016]. Under these rules, the right to indigenous knowledge systems and practices is an inherent part of their cultural patrimony, which ICCs/IPPs have the right to regulate access for research and documentation and which they have the right to own, control, develop and protect \[@RevisedGuidelinesFree2012\][@RulesRegulationsIntellectual2016].[^42] Although the guidelines were issued in relation to large scale/extractive/intrusive activities, NPC has considered the guidelines in obtaining consent from ICCs [@NPCAdvisoryOpinionb].

The Philippines has particular controls on the prospecting of biological and genetic resources for scientific and commercial purposes. Executive Order No. 247, promulgated by the Philippine President in 1995, establishes a regulatory framework for such prospecting of biological and genetic resources as well as their by-products and derivatives [@PrescribingGuidelinesEstablishing1995]. If the prospecting were to be within the ancestral lands and domains of ICCs, the prior informed consent of such communities must be obtained, in accordance with the customary laws of the concerned communities. The executive order requires the prior informed consent of the concerned local communities even if the prospecting does not involve ICCs.

An incident in 2021 illustrates the degree of control that IPs maintain under the law over their own data \-- their genetic data in particular. Following the publication of a landmark study tracing the genetic history of the Filipino people that had relied on 1,094 individual saliva samples sourced from various IPP communities, it was revealed that the researcher who oversaw the study had not secured the necessary clearances from the NCIP. This was characterized by NPC in an advisory opinion as a failure to secure the requisite informed consent from the IPPs, notwithstanding the researcher\'s claims that they had secured the consent directly from the subjects [@NPCAdvisoryOpinionb]. NPC concluded that the failure to comply with the procedural and documentary requirements on consent as prescribed by the NCIP resulted in invalid informed consent as required under the Indigenous People\'s Rights Act [@IndigenousPeoplesRights1997]. Despite the pronouncement, the advisory opinion did not impose any sanctions or award damages on account of the violation.

##### Privacy and Data Concerns

The DPA is \[a comprehensive\]{.mark} statute on personal data protection. While its implementation is oriented towards the protection of individual privacy rights, it imposes obligations to protect personal data on controllers or processors, including Philippine government agencies who act in such capacity. Failure to comply with these obligations may result in the imposition not just of administrative, but also criminal penalties. The threat of liability on government controllers and processors has thus resulted in the embedding, whether formally or unofficially, of data privacy justifications in denying access to or withholding government data. Further, as the unnecessary retention of personal data records increases the risk of liability for controllers/processors under the Act, data privacy considerations have also influenced data retention policies within the government.

Personal information must be retained only for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the data was obtained, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, for legitimate purposes or as provided by law [@DataPrivacyAct2012].[^43] This, however, does not affect the accessibility of information *per se* (i.e., it neither decreases nor increases openness of the data to the public); it is merely a mandate to retain for as long as necessary.

With respect to government data, NAP has published a General Records Disposition Schedule common to all government agencies that lists the retention periods of data depending on the type.

There is currently no law governing data localization. However, DICT has prescribed, through a circular, the Philippine Government\'s Cloud First Policy, which includes a provision on data residency [@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017]. Section 12.2 of the circular as amended states that \"\[a\]s a general rule, no residency restrictions shall be placed on government data stored or processed in the cloud, provided that appropriate controls or security measures are present.\" By way of exception, the storage or processing of sensitive, above-sensitive and highly-sensitive government data were made subject of some residency restrictions [@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017].[^44] The data residency in such cases is restricted to the Philippine territory or (only in the case of sensitive government data) also to other states with which the Philippines has enforceable extradition treaties for the turn-over of persons accused or convicted of violating Philippine laws [@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017].[^45]

Data-sharing agreements across government agencies are further governed by NPC Circular No. 16-02. The Implementing Rules to the DPA require that any sharing of personal data for commercial purposes, or between government agencies for a public function or provision of a public service, be covered by a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement must be in writing, and must contain mandatory provisions such as the purpose of the agreement, the controllers party to the agreement, the type of data to be shared, the processors who will have access to the data, the designated data protection or compliance officer, the term of the agreement, the operational details for the sharing or transfer of personal data, and the general description of security measures that protect the personal data. Data sharing is allowed only where there are adequate safeguards for data privacy and security, and any online access granted by a government agency to personal data under its control or custody must be done via a secure encrypted link.

##### Disclosures Related to Money Laundering Statutes

To protect and preserve the integrity and confidentiality of bank accounts, the Philippines enacted the 2001 Anti-Money Laundering Act [@AntiMoneyLaunderingAct2001]. Under this Act, as amended, covered persons[^46] are required to report covered and suspicious transactions to the AMLC. The 2018 Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-Money Laundering Act lists the following covered transactions: 1) a transaction in cash or other equivalent monetary instrument exceeding 500,000 pesos (PHP500,000.00); 2) a transaction with or involving jewelry dealers, dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones in cash or other equivalent monetary instrument exceeding 1,000,000 pesos (PHP1,000,000); and 3) a casino cash transaction exceeding 5,000,000 pesos (PHP5,000,000) or its equivalent in other currency [@2018ImplementingRules2018].[^47] In addition, transactions that are considered suspicious or transactions that were conducted or happened under suspicious circumstances [@AntiMoneyLaunderingAct2003][^48] are also reported to AMLC [@AntiMoneyLaunderingAct2003].[^49] Suspicious transactions that are related to terrorism financing, pursuant to the 2012 Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act, are also reported to the AMLC [@ActDefiningCrime2012].[^50]

Under the 2021 AMLC Registration and Reporting Guidelines, the Covered Transaction Reports and Suspicious Transaction Reports are submitted in electronic form and filed through AMLC\'s File Transfer and Reporting Facility [@AMLCRegistration2021]. The guidelines also list the specific information required to be included in the reports such as the transaction date and time, transaction amount, nature and purpose of the transaction, information about the parties involved and other participants (such as counterparty, issuer, transactor, etc.,) and details of suspicion, if applicable [@AMLCRegistration2021].[^51]

##### Establishing and maintaining government digitized databases

Several laws or regulations impose standards and limitations, whether technical or basic, in the collection, storage and processing of government-held or controlled data. These standards and limitations, insofar as they mandate or rationalize the organization of government data, generally operate to promote openness.

A common feature of these laws or regulations is the collation of specific records into government-maintained databases. It is noticeable that in recent years, statutes have become more explicit in requiring that the specific information relevant to the particular statute, whenever collected or processed by a government agency, be maintained in a database. This can be attributed to a recognition of increased digitalization of government records, even if such digitalization does not necessarily lead to an explicit grant of access to the public of such data.

One of the most significant data collection activities embarked upon by the Philippine government is, through the 2017 Philippine Identification System Act, the collection of personal information of all Philippine citizens and resident aliens for the purpose of issuing an official government-issued identification document known as the PhilID, with the underlying information stored in a registry known as the PhilSys Registry [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018]. The personal information collected covers a person\'s full name, sex, blood type, marital status, date and place of birth, address, a front-facing photograph, fingerprint information, an iris scan, and other biometric information [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018].[^52] Each registrant, as well as a person upon birth, is assigned a randomly generated, unique and permanent identification number [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018].[^53] The resulting PhilID contains a QR code with the fingerprint information and other security features as safeguards for data privacy and security and the prevention of falsified cards [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018].[^54]

An individual\'s record in the Registry is considered to be an official and sufficient proof of identity,[^55] with the PhilID mandated by the law to be honored and accepted, subject to authentication, in all transactions requiring proof or verification of identity [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018].[^56] With this requirement, it is expected that more citizens would be able to engage in transactions that require proof of identity, thus allowing for greater financial inclusion. The greater engagement of citizens in such transactions could potentially have the effect of increasing data flows through the increased generation of data resulting from these transactions.

###### CMBS Database

Another notable recent legislated database was created through the 2018 Community-Based Monitoring System Act, a law that recognized that effective poverty reduction programs of the state would be greatly enabled by a community-based monitoring system (\"CMBS\") that \"generates updated and disaggregated data necessary in targeting beneficiaries, conducting more comprehensive poverty analysis and needs prioritization, designing appropriate policies and interventions, and monitoring impact over time\" [@CommunityBasedMonitoringSystem2019]. The resulting CMBS as defined by law is \"an organized technology-based system of collecting, processing and validating necessary disaggregated data that may be used for planning, program implementation and impact monitoring at the local level while empowering communities to participate in the process.\" The data is collected at the level of local governments (i.e., cities and municipalities), and pertains to a \"compendium of localized facts, figures, and maps on the different dimensions of poverty such as health, nutrition, water, sanitation, shelter, education, income, employment, security, and participation.\" The right to privacy though of respondents is recognized as inviolable, with the participation of residents being purely voluntary. The CMBS is instituted in every city and municipality, with said local governments now required to have a statistician, whose primary function is data collection, preservation, and safekeeping. Data collection is required every three years, with the local governments allowed to maintain their own CBMS database for use in local level planning and program implementation. The data collated is to be used by appropriate national government agencies in prioritizing timely, relevant, and much-needed social protection programs of government in areas identified to have the highest incidence of poverty.

###### Law Enforcement Databases

A set of databases maintained by individual government agencies serve the purpose of facilitating law enforcement and the investigation of crimes. A database serving as a \"modern NBI Clearance and Identification Center\" is required under the 2016 NBI Reorganization and Modernization Act to be established by the National Bureau of Investigation (\"NBI\") for civilian identification, including individual identifying marks, fingerprints, and dental records, as well as all derogatory and criminal records [@NationalBureauInvestigation2016].[^57] The NBI is also required to maintain databases for ballistic records of firearms, and a DNA databank [@NationalBureauInvestigation2016].[^58] The Anti-Terrorism Council is required under the 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act to \"establish and maintain comprehensive database information systems on terrorism, terrorist activities, and counter-terrorism operations\" [@AntiTerrorismAct20202020].[^59] A government coordinating body tasked with enforcing anti-trafficking and laws against the online sexual exploitation of children is required to maintain a database (including such information as fingerprints and complete criminal history) of all adults convicted of sexual abuse or exploitation of children [@AntiOnlineSexualAbuse2022].[^60] The Land Transportation Office is required under the 2019 Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act [@MotorcycleCrimePrevention2019] to maintain and a database registry of motorcycles, including details about the vehicles\' owners, to facilitate retrieval for official investigation and law enforcement purposes[^61]; the general law on motor vehicle registration enacted in 1964 [@LandTransportationTraffic1964] as well as the law establishing the Land Transportation Office [@EstablishingLandTransportation1985][^62] had been silent on the maintenance of a general database or registry of all motorized land vehicles even as it had required their registration.[^63]

In connection with the enforcement of the Philippine money-laundering law, the Anti-Money Laundering Council was authorized under the Implementing Rules of the Anti-Money Laundering Act to establish an information sharing system to enable the storing, tracking and analysis of money laundering transactions for the prevention, detection and investigation of money laundering offenses [@AMLA2001Amended2018]. The Council was thus mandated to install a computerized system to be used in the creation and maintenance of an information database [@AntiMoneyLaunderingAct2003].[^64] Philippine money-laundering laws also impose requirements on private sector-held data; covered institutions such as banks are required not only to report so-called covered customer transactions that meet prescribed threshold amounts, but also to maintain such records of transactions for at least 5 years [@AntiMoneyLaunderingAct2001].[^65] While the law itself was silent as to the standards to be applied for the maintenance of these records, the Implementing Rules as revised in 2018 required those a subset of covered person \-- those considered as \"complex\" \-- to adopt an electronic anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing system capable of monitoring risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as generating timely reports for the guidance and information of its board of directors and senior management [@AMLA2001Amended2018].[^66]

##### SIM Card Registration Information

The 2022 SIM Card Registration Act was enacted to provide law enforcement agencies the tools to resolve crimes which involve the utilization of SIM cards used to empower cellular phone subscription accounts [@SIMCardRegistration2022]. All end-users are required under the law to register their SIMs with the public telecommunications entities providing the account, utilizing government-issued ID cards or similar identity documents [@SIMCardRegistration2022]. The end-users are also to provide their full name, date of birth, sex, and address, with the registration form accomplished electronically through a platform or website to be provided by the public telecommunications entities (PTEs) [@SIMCardRegistration2022]. Access to the information in the database maintained by the PTEs may be mandated by a duly-issued subpoena by a competent authority pursuant to an investigation based on a sworn complaint that a specific mobile number was or is being used in the commission of a crime or that it was utilized as a means to commit a malicious, fraudulent or unlawful act, and that the complaint is unable to ascertain the identity of the perpetrator [@SIMCardRegistration2022].

#### Decreasing Openness to Favor Individuals

##### Justified by Protection of Individual Privacy Rights

Several Philippine statutes impose confidentiality requirements intended to protect the privacy rights of individuals. The statute on personal data protection is the most comprehensive of these laws.

The 2012 DPA requires lawful basis for the processing of personally identifying information, with the standards for lawful basis prescribed in the law itself [@DataPrivacyAct2012]. The law also guarantees data subjects \-- any natural person \-- several rights with respect to their personally identifying information. The operative effects of these twin concepts have resulted in significant limitations in the collection, sharing, transfer and use of personal data, perhaps to an unprecedented extent considering that proprietary rights to data itself had not been well-defined up until the law\'s passage.

The underlying premise of the 2012 DPA is the protection of an individual\'s constitutional right to privacy. The constitutional right to privacy as recognized in the Philippines embodies several facets, e.g., privacy attaching to certain locations such as one\'s home (locational privacy) and the right to make intimate personal decisions without interference from the state. The right to privacy of one\'s personally identifying information was recognized by the Philippine Supreme Court before the enactment of DPA, in its 1998 decision in *Ople v. Torres* [@BlasOpleRuben1998]. Nonetheless, the subsequent law ushered in a more definitive regime for the protection of personal data. Most crucially, unlike the basic framework of the Bill of Rights where individual rights are guaranteed protection against interference by State actors, data privacy under the DPA protects one\'s personal data privacy from infringement by non-state actors, i.e., the private sector, to the extent that there are now significant limitations on freedom of action by the private actors who control the use of personally-identifying information of other people.

With the DPA, one\'s personally identifying information can only be processed by another if there is lawful basis for processing, as enumerated under Sections 12 and 13 of the Act, with heightened restrictions for sensitive personal information. The consent to processing by the data subject, in recorded form, is one of the grounds for processing, and arguably the most prevalent one.

In understanding the effects of the DPA, lawful bases must also be seen in conjunction with the rights of a data subject as enumerated in the law. A data subject is capacitated by the law to invoke these rights against any natural or juridical person who controls the processing of the data subject\'s information, towards the end of restricting if not terminating the ability to process the personal information. Thus, any public access rights or data sharing/transfer arrangements that the controller may have enabled could be thwarted. Even the content of the personal data may be altered or deleted due to the data subject\'s invocation of their rights.

Under the General Data Privacy Principles of the DPA, personal data must be retained only for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the data was obtained or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or for legitimate business purposes, or as provided by law [@DataPrivacyAct2012].[^67] Thereafter, personal data should be disposed of or discarded in a secure manner that would prevent further processing, unauthorized access, or disclosure to any other party or the public, or prejudice the interests of the data subjects [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^68]

In addition, there was also a specific mention of the non-applicability of the provisions on the rights of the data subject, transmissibility of rights of the data subject and the right to data portability of the DPA on data used only for needs of scientific and statistical research. Such use, however, is combined with the responsibility that the data is held under strict confidentiality and used only for the declared purpose. It should be noted though that the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the DPA seemingly added a specific requirement under this exception, i.e., for data to be exempted from the application of DPA, the research should be \"intended for a public benefit, \[and\] subject to the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, or ethical standards\" [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^69]

With respect to cross-border data transfers, although there are no specific restrictions, the NPC has addressed the matter of free flow of data in relation to the DPA. It stated in an opinion that the DPA \"concerns itself with the free flow of data but limited to the specific context of personal data processing\" [@NPCAdvisoryOpinion2022]. Transfer of personal data, including cross-border transfers are expected to adhere to the general privacy principles [@NPCAdvisoryOpinion2022].[^70] Transfer of personal data (whether within or across borders) would be considered as processing, which under the DPA can only be permitted if it fulfills any of the criteria as enumerated under Section 12 and Section 13 (for sensitive personal information) of the law. Controllers are accountable and are expected to ensure that \"recipients of personal data outside the Philippines process data in a manner consistent with the requirements of the DPA and must put in place contractual or other reasonable safeguards to guarantee a comparable level of protection for data transferred\" [@NPCAdvisoryOpinion2022].

Other statutes also establish context-specific privacy rights in favor of individuals.

The 2013 Philippine Statistical Act that implements the PhilSys ID system classifies as privileged communication (and thus inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding) individual data furnished by a respondent to the PSA concerning statistical inquiries, surveys and census [@PhilippineStatisticalAct2013].[^71] Information collected by the PSA in the implementation of the national ID system under the 2017 PhilSys Act is similarly covered under the protection [@PhilippineIdentificationSystems2018]. SIM card registration information is also treated as absolutely confidential under Section 9 of the 2022 SIM Card Registration Act [@SIMCardRegistration2022].

Other laws address the privacy concerns of individual members of vulnerable sectors. The 2004 Violence Against Women and Their Children Act imposes confidentiality requirements for all records pertaining to cases of violence against women and their children, with violations of confidentiality punishable with contempt of court [@AntiViolenceWomenTheir2004].[^72] The 2022 Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Materials Act similarly requires that any record concerning a victim of child sexual abuse or exploitation be kept confidential [@AntiViolenceWomenTheir2004].[^73] The names of children alleged, accused of, or adjudged as having committed a criminal offense under Philippine law are required to be kept confidential under the 2006 Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act [@JuvenileJusticeWelfare2006].[^74] Confidentiality of persons with HIV or AIDS is required under the 2018 Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act [@PhilippineHIVAIDS2018][^75], and for all relevant information related to persons with psychiatric, neurologic, and psychological health needs under the 2018 Mental Health Act [@MentalHealthAct2018].[^76]

The 2008 Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data was promulgated by the Philippine Supreme Court to provide a judicial remedy to persons whose right to privacy in life, liberty or security is violated or threatened by an unlawful act or omission, whether by a public official or employee, or by a private individual, or by an entity engaged in the gathering, collecting or storing of data or information regarding the person, family, home and correspondence of the aggrieved party [@RuleWritHabeas2008]. The courts, through this writ, may, after deliberating on the petition, order the deletion, destruction or rectification of the erroneous data or information. The rule was enacted prior to the 2012 DPA, which offers similar relief, though primarily through an administrative agency \-- NPC. Nonetheless, the Rule on Habeas Data remains in force and available as a remedy.

##### In Favor of Promoting Intellectual Property Rights

Copyright is a legal protection afforded to literary, scholarly, scientific, and artistic works, and derivative works [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^77] It gives the owner of the copyright exclusive right to carry out, authorize or prevent the following acts: a) reproduction of the work or substantial portion of the work; b) dramatization, translation, adaptation, abridgment, arrangement or other transformation of the work; c) the first public distribution of the original and each copy of the work by sale or other forms of transfer of ownership; d) rental of the original or a copy of an audiovisual or cinematographic work, a work embodied in a sound recording, a computer program, a compilation of data and other materials or a musical work in graphic form, irrespective of the ownership of the original or the copy which is the subject of the rental; e) public display of the original or a copy of the work; f) public performance of the work; and g) other communication to the public of the work. In addition, Section 173.1(b) of the 1997 Intellectual Property Code protects derivative works as new works, including compilations of data and other materials which are original by reason of the selection or coordination or arrangement of their contents. This protection does not affect the force of any subsisting copyright upon the original works employed or any part thereof, nor can it be construed to imply any right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^78] This provision on derivative works is, so far, the only provision that might relate to web scraping considering that currently, there are no specific laws or regulations in the Philippines that intentionally regulate web scraping. The works are generally protected by copyright during the lifetime of the author and for 50 years after their death [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^79]

One of the limitations of the rights given to copyright owners is the exception of fair use of copyrighted work from being considered as an infringement of copyright [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997]. Section 185 of the 1997 Intellectual Property Code states \"\[t\]he fair use of a copyrighted work for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching including limited number of copies for classroom use, scholarship, research, and similar purposes is not an infringement of copyright.\" Under the 1997 Intellectual Property Code, decompilation, which is understood to be the reproduction of the code and translation of the forms of a computer program to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs may also constitute fair use, to the extent that such decompilation is done for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs. In addition, the lawful owner of a computer program may create one (1) back-up copy or adaptation of a computer program even without the authorization of the author or copyright owner of a computer program, as long as such copy or adaptation is necessary for the use of the computer program in conjunction with a computer, and for archival or replacement purposes in the event that the original program is lost or rendered unusable [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^80]

With respect to authorship, it should be noted though that the 1997 Intellectual Property Code does not recognize works that were purely generated by artificial intelligence. Under the 1997 Intellectual Property Code, copyright over original literary and artistic works generally belong to the author, who under the law, is defined as a \"natural person,\" thus excluding non-humans, as well as juridical persons [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^81] Currently, there are no laws or regulations in the Philippines that specifically govern AI authorship.

Copyright over original literary and artistic works belong by default to the author unless the work was created pursuant to a commission or in the course of employment [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^82] Copyright may likewise be assigned, even to a juridical person [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^83]

Independent of copyright, the author of a work also has \"moral rights,\" which include the right of attribution, the withholding of a work from publication, and the prevention of any alteration or modification of the work [@IntellectualPropertyCode1997].[^84]

The Philippines protects undisclosed information or trade secrets. It is listed in the Intellectual Property Code as one of the intellectual property rights in accordance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\"TRIPS Agreement\")[@TRIPS1995]. Under the TRIPS Agreement, undisclosed information is protected. Undisclosed information is defined as \"any form or type of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic or engineering information, including the whole or any portion or phase of any process, procedure, formula, improvement, pattern, plan, design, prototype, code, compilation, program, method, technique, or listing of names, addresses or telephone numbers, whether tangible or intangible, stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing\" [@TRIPS1995].[^85] This protection includes being immune from modes of discovery. Some noted exceptions to the rule on non-disclosure of undisclosed information includes cases when courts may require the disclosure of information \"where it is indispensable for doing justice\" and in cases when other applicable laws \[\-\--\]{.mark} for instance in cases regarding consumer products \[\-\--\]{.mark} require it [@AirPhilippinesCorporation2007].

##### Data Privacy and Security

###### Online Traffic Data

The 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act makes specific impositions on entities that provide users the ability to communicate by means of a computer system or those that process or store computer data on behalf of such communications service (collectively, \"service providers\") with respect to \"traffic data\", or any computer data other than the content of the communication including, but not limited to, the communication\'s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service [@CybercrimePreventionAct2012]. Service providers are required to preserve for a period of at least six months such traffic data as well as the subscriber information (including assigned network addresses) associated with the traffic data [@CybercrimePreventionAct2012]. Such information may be disclosed to law enforcement if authorized under a court warrant; the six-month preservation period enables law enforcement to secure the information necessary for a warrant [@CybercrimePreventionAct2012].

Another provision of the 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act, which would have authorized law enforcement authorities to collect or record traffic data in real time even without a warrant as long as there was \"due cause\", was struck down by the Philippine Supreme Court as unconstitutional in the case of *Disini v. Secretary of Justice* \[@CybercrimePreventionAct2012\][@JoseJesusDisini2014]. The court agreed with the observation that \"when seemingly random bits of traffic data are gathered in bulk, pooled together, and analyzed, they reveal patterns of activities which can then be used to create profiles of the persons under surveillance\", with analysts then able to determine \"a person\'s close associations, religious views, political affiliations, even sexual preferences\" [@JoseJesusDisini2014]. For that reason, the court held that the Cybercrime Prevention Act should have been narrowly drawn to protect individual rights, and that the legislated standard of \"due cause\" was too general, empowering law enforcement with unlimited authority that threatens an individual\'s right to privacy. Notably, the questioned provision ultimately failed because the collection of traffic data was authorized without needing to secure a court-issued search warrant. Nonetheless, the court acknowledged that the Budapest Convention on Cybercrimes requires signatory countries to adopt legislative measures to empower state authorities to collect or record traffic data in real time; the Philippines only acceded to the Budapest convention in 2018, or 4 years after the Philippine Supreme Court\'s decision in *Disini v. Secretary of Justice*.

###### Data Security Measures

The DPA requires personal data controllers, including the government, to implement reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures for the protection of personal data. For government agencies that control the processing of personal information, the NPC issued Circular No. 16-01 governing security of personal data in government agencies. Section 6 of the circular recommends the use of the ISO/IEC 27002 control set as the minimum standard to assess any gaps in the agency\'s control framework. In Section 12 of the circular, the NPC recommends ISO/IEC 27018 as the most appropriate certification for the service or function provided by a service provider that is engaged either for the storage of data or as a personal information processor acting under the control of the agency. These measures precede the Cloud First Policy for government data issued by the DICT.

###### Private Sector Mandates Relating to Data Protection Measures

The relevant private sector mandates concerning standards generally pertain to data or information security. The existence of these mandates may have the effect of limiting the collection or processing of data, especially if the compliance costs limit data processing by private sector entities. However, the required security measures may also promote openness as they better ensure the quality of data, thus increasing confidence in their use.

***Applicable to all private sector entities***

The DPA requires personal data controllers, including the government, to implement reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures intended for the protection of personal data [@DataPrivacyAct2012].[^86] These measures are intended for the protection of personal information against any accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration, and disclosure, as well as any other unlawful processing. A personal information controller is required to implement such measures to protect personal information against both natural dangers (such as accidental loss or destruction) as well as human dangers. The need for such security measures is reiterated in the implementing rules and regulations of DPA [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016][^87], which requires an entity involved in the processing of personal data to maintain records that sufficiently describes their data processing system, including a general description of the organizational, physical, and technical security measures in place [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^88]

Notably, the detailed technical data security requirements issued by the NPC for government agencies processing personal data, such as the requirement for encryption of data and the recommended ISO/IEC 27018 standard, are not applicable to the private sector. The private sector thus has more leeway in determining what data security measures they can adopt with respect to personal data that they control or process.

Several categories of personal data are exempt from the scope of DPA. These includes \"personal information processed for journalistic, artistic, literary or research purposes,\" thus enabling journalists among others to perform their work without fear [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^89] However, the exemption is qualified. Personal information processed for journalistic,[^90] artistic or literary purposes is only exempted if it is done \"to uphold freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, \[and is\] subject to requirements of other applicable law or regulations\" [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^91] On the other hand, personal information processed for research purposes is only exempt \"if it is intended for a public benefit \[and is\] subject to the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, or ethical standards\" [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^92]

Another important exemption relates to matters of public concern, such as information about individuals employed by government with respect to their positions or functions, or information relating to discretionary benefits of a financial nature given by the government to an individual, or information about individuals performing services under contract to the government that relates to the services performed [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^93]

Yet another important category of exempted personal data relates to data necessary to carry out the functions of public authority, such as law enforcement or regulatory authorities who would necessarily need to process personal information as they undertake their investigatory functions [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^94] Information relevant to enforcement of banking and money-laundering laws are similarly exempt [@ImplementingRulesRegulations2016].[^95]

***Applicable to specific private sector entities***

DICT, through Memorandum Circular No. 05 (2017), has adopted rules and regulations that apply to private sector entities whose computer systems or networks are deemed as \"Critical Information Infrastructure\" (CII) \-\-- systems deemed so vital to the country that interference with them, their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national or economic security, national health, or a combination of such matters [@PrescribingPoliciesRules2017].[^96] Private sector entities that have been classified as CIIs are those engaged in transportation, energy, water, health, emergency services, banking and finance, business process outsourcing, telecommunications, and media.

CIIs are required to comply with the Philippine National Standard on Information Security Management System ISO/IEC 27001 [@PrescribingPoliciesRules2017].[^97] CIIs are required to participate in an annual security assessment program by DICT that includes a security evaluation of operational systems based on ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 [@PrescribingPoliciesRules2017].[^98] CIIs are also required to create their own Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT), and to secure from DICT a Certificate of Cybersecurity Compliance based on criteria stipulated in ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO 18045 as reference standards.

In 2020, through DICT Circular No. 10 (2020)[@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020], the Philippine Cloud First Policy was expanded to cover not just government agencies, but also \"cloud service providers, intermediaries, and other private entities with transactions, contracts, or data related to, in connection with, or arising from the rendition of cloud computing services for the Philippine government\" \[@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017\][@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020].[^99] However, unlike government agencies, such private entities are not required to adopt cloud computing as the preferred ICT deployment strategy \[@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017\][@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020][^100] or to utilize the data classification models prescribed by the policy for government agencies \[@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017\][@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020].[^101] Such covered private sector entities are, by virtue of the amended circular, subject to restrictions when processing government data, including the recognition of the authority of the Philippine government to determine the management, use, processing, storage, security and accessibility of its data with sole control over the encryption keys thereto \[@PrescribingPhilippineGovernments2017\][@AmendmentsDepartmentCircular2020].[^102]

###### Exceptions to Data Security for Law Enforcement

The Bill of Rights of the Philippine Constitution specifically guarantees that \"the privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable, except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise, as prescribed by law.\" In relation to this, several laws have provided specific circumstances when interception of computer data by law enforcement authorities may be allowed.

First, in connection with cybercrime offenses, the interception of computer data by law enforcement authorities may be authorized by the trial courts by virtue of a warrant to intercept computer data that allows authorities to listen, record, monitor or surveil the content of communications, including the procuring of content of computer data through access and use of a computer system [@RuleCybercrimeWarrants2018]. The application for the warrant must establish, among others, the existence of a probable cybercrime offense, and the communication or computer data that is sought to be intercepted.

In connection with suspected terrorists or members of terrorist organizations, the 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act allows for the Court of Appeals to issue an order authorizing law enforcement or military to secretly wiretap, listen to, or intercept any private communications between such suspects [@AntiTerrorismAct2020]. The order may be issued by the Court of Appeals upon determination that there is probable cause that any of the crimes defined under the Anti-Terrorism Act has been, is being, or is about to be committed.

In connection with offenses related to online sexual abuse or exploitation of children or child sexual abuse or exploitation materials, the 2022 Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act [@AntiOnlineSexualAbuse2022], law enforcement officers may be authorized by a regional trial court to track, intercept, view, monitor, surveil, listen to, and record, by technical or electronic means, any communications, information or messages, including the procurement of content data, transmitted by means of a computer system involving at least one person reasonably believed to have committed violations under the said law [@AntiOnlineSexualAbuse2022].[^103] In addition, the law specifically states that when the offense involves the use of computer systems and digital platforms, a court order shall not be required for a law enforcement officer acting in an undercover capacity to intercept a communication with a person reasonably believed to have committed, committing, or about to commit any of the violations in the said law [@AntiOnlineSexualAbuse2022].[^104] In instances when an order is required, the application must establish that: there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the crimes covered has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed; there are reasonable grounds to believe that evidence that will be obtained is essential to the conviction of any person for, or to the solution of, or to the prevention of, any such crime; and there are no other means readily available for obtaining such evidence [@AntiOnlineSexualAbuse2022].[^105]

# Recommendations Towards Increasing Data Flows

The above survey of laws and policies establishes that despite the absence thus far of any comprehensive data governance law, there is an existing framework that takes into account the importance of generating and preserving information for policy making and enforcement concerns, the constitutional right to access to information, as well as other constitutional concerns such as the right to privacy. A comprehensive law will be expected to address these same concerns. It is also notable that Philippine policy makers are increasingly cognizant that digitization and online access allow for more comprehensive data collection and sharing.

However, certain real-world practices have been known to frustrate access or sharing of data, even if such access or sharing is warranted under the circumstances.

### Absence of a Unified/Centralized Framework for Inter-Government Sharing and Providing Open Access to Government Data

The multiple individual government databases that implement the Open Data Policy, notwithstanding there being an ostensibly centralized Open Data website, highlights the fact that the sharing or granting of access to data by individual government agencies is not a given, even if each of these agencies belong to just one government. The fact that the Open Data website is not even able to link to PSA\'s more comprehensive data sets all but highlights the failure for now of the public-facing aspects of the Open Data Policy.

This lack of inter-agency coordination and cooperation has also hampered the expeditious implementation of the FOI program. The researchers conducted a key informant interview with a former ranking government official who was tasked with administering the FOI program until 2022. He expressed frustration with other government agencies who, under various justifications, would be hesitant to either share data even in the context of fulfilling an FOI request. Such hesitance also accounts for the failure of the Open Data Policy. In his opinion, the FOI Ordinance is not sufficient. It is necessary to legislate an FOI statute to compel the effective implementation of FOI. Indeed, the absence of an FOI statute has resulted in more closed data flows. The President cannot contravene confidentiality requirements imposed by other laws or by jurisprudence even as they implement the right to access information on public concerns, hence the many exceptions to the enforcement of the current FOI Ordinance. Many of these confidentiality requirements were imposed by laws from a different era with a different mindset about the value of access to information, which was enshrined in the Philippine Constitution in 1973. A new FOI law would afford Congress the opportunity to revisit some of these exceptions in light of the experience gained from the working of the ordinance, where the value of information or data has become more clearly palpable. According to the global rankings maintained by Open Data Watch, the Philippines has declined in terms of open data from 18\^th\^ out of 187 in 2020 to 37\^th\^ out of 197 in 2024. An FOI statute would help reverse such decline.

It is telling that existing laws or regulations may give hesitant government agencies colorable legal justification to withhold government data, even if requested by other government agencies. For example, the statutory mandate of PSA plainly establishes that agency\'s role as the primary collator and processor of government statistical information. Data collection and processing undertaken by other government agencies, in contrast, are merely incidental to the performance of their respective statutory mandates. The primary mandate of PSA when it comes to statistical data, thus, gives it authority not only to implement autonomous open data access policies or platforms but also to refuse interconnection or sharing with other agencies on the ground that its own mandate would be diminished.

Another statute that has operated to inhibit data sharing within government is DPA. The Act has been commonly invoked towards the end of denying access to information. At times, the invocation can be misplaced, such as when it is intended to shield government data that cannot be used to identify specific individuals and is hence outside the scope of the Act [@NotContradictionPrivacy2020].

Moreover, the law itself acknowledges the right to access of information on matters of public concern, thus exempting from its scope personal information about public officials relating to their public functions, or those performing services under government contracts or about recipients of discretionary benefits of a financial nature [@DataPrivacyAct2012].[^106] The law also excludes information necessary to carry out functions of public authorities such as law enforcement agencies [@DataPrivacyAct2012].[^107] However, Sections 25 of the law also imposes criminal penalties including prison time for unauthorized processing of personal information, an act that includes disclosures of personal information that violate the law. Section 36 also provides that if the convicted offender is a public officer, they would be disqualified from occupying public office for a term double the term of the criminal penalty. The prospect of these twin punishments has resulted in public officers being extremely conservative in disclosing personal information even if outside the scope of the Act and even if clearly within the scope of the right to access to information on matters of public concern. The same fear has also deterred easy access to civil registry and land registry records. Instead, one who is denied the right to access such information is forced to resort to initiating prolonged judicial proceedings. The removal of these criminal penalties under DPA, and confining punishments to administrative fines, would inevitably lead public custodians of data to be more liberal than they are right now in disclosing information.

Whether justified by exposure to legal liability or by relatively trivial concerns about agency diminution, the clear absence of a data sharing mandate within government hampers the ability of different agencies to adopt data-based policy making that ensures that decisions on public issues and services are made based on evidence, expertise, and science. Legislated statutes may address the gap, but it is already possible for executive action, through an executive order, to require data sharing and prescribe any necessary safeguards for the protection of individual rights such as that of privacy. The President is recognized by the Constitution as having control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices [@ConstitutionRepublicPhilippines1987].[^108] By virtue of such authority, the President may require inter-agency sharing of information; the FOI Statute already stands as one standing example, as does 1993 Executive Order No. 53, which directs all government agencies to provide the national taxation authorities with the necessary information to help increase tax collections. The President could even revive the apparently moribund PeGIF initiative, which would have required individual government agencies to adopt common standard definitions for the purpose of ensuring interoperability of data. The fact that the PeGIF initiative has not moved forward is an indication of the low priority within the executive branch of implementing open data and inter-agency sharing of information.

### Increasing Access to Traffic Data

The restrictions imposed on the use by law enforcement of internet traffic data (\"traffic data\"), with the Supreme Court-imposed requirement of a judicial warrant, through *Disini v. Secretary of Justice*, has also hampered the investigation of cybercrimes by law enforcement. The collection of traffic data is often but the first step in the investigation of cybercrimes, especially since most cybercriminals are canny enough to take steps to hide under the cloak of anonymity as they undertake their online criminal activity. Without traffic data, law enforcement would usually be unable to even identify which online accounts or IP addresses are involved in the commission of cybercrimes.

The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime itself recognizes the unique nature of traffic data. It distinguishes traffic data from either content data, subscriber information, or stored computer data. Traffic data, which is non-identifying in nature, is treated distinctly under the Convention with the requirement for its expedited preservation and expedited partial disclosure. The Convention requires State parties to ensure the \"expeditious disclosures\" to a competent authority of a sufficient amount of traffic data to enable the identification of service providers and the path through which the communication was transmitted and to adopt legislative and other measures to empower competent authorities to compel service providers to collect or record traffic data in real-time or to themselves collect or record through technical means such traffic data.

The Convention does not require a judicial warrant to obtain traffic data; it recognizes that a \"production order\" may be required for computer data or subscriber information, but not for traffic data. However, a \"production order\" or warrant is now required in the Philippines on account of the *Disini v. Secretary of Justice* decision. A search warrant in the Philippines calls for the application of Section 2, Article III, otherwise known as the Bill of Rights of the Philippine Constitution, which requires that an application for a search warrant be granted only upon \"probable cause\" to be determined personally by a judge after examination under oath of the complainant and the witnesses they may produce. The Supreme Court itself has implemented the warrant requirement it prescribed through the 2018 Rule on Cybercrime Warrants. The Rules do allow law enforcement authorities to, without need of judicial intervention, direct service providers to preserve traffic data for a period of six months from the date of transaction [@RuleCybercrimeWarrants2018].[^109] However, law enforcement is not able to access such preserved traffic data without obtaining from a court a Warrant to Disclose Computer Data (WDCD). The WDCD is also resorted to for law enforcement to obtain subscriber information and content data in the possession of service providers, notwithstanding the differentiated treatment of these different data categories under the Budapest Convention.

The application for a court-issued WDCD requires law enforcement to identify several pieces of information that satisfy the Constitution\'s probable cause requirement, probable cause requiring \"such facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonably prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed and the objects sought in connection with that offense are in the place to be searched\" [@MicrosoftCorporationLotus2004]. The Rules on Cybercrime Warrants conflate the warrant requirements for traffic data, content data, and subscriber information even if the Budapest Convention differentiates all three. These burdensome requirements were necessitated by the inadequacies perceived by the Supreme Court over the 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act when it decided *Disini* *v. Secretary of Justice* in 2014. However, it can be argued that a supervening event has since taken place \-- the accession by the Philippines to the Budapest Convention in 2018. The Convention was transformed into part of the law of the Philippines following its ratification by the Philippine Senate in February 2018.

The provisions of the Budapest Convention have since become binding on the Philippines. Thus, the Philippines obliges itself to \"ensure the expeditious disclosure\... of a sufficient amount of traffic data,\" to enable the identification of service providers and the path through which the communication was transmitted. Arguably, the WDCD and the constitutional necessity to produce probable cause do not serve the obligation to \"ensure the expeditious disclosure of traffic data.\" At the same time, because such obligations were not yet binding on the Philippines when *Disini v. Secretary of Justice* was decided, the applicable legal landscape that the Supreme Court needed to grapple with at that time has been altered in present day.

The *Disini v. Secretary of Justice* decision was especially concerned that the disclosure of traffic data was not subject to judicial authorization. It can be argued that the applicable procedural rules can be duly modified to address both the Supreme Court\'s concerns and the extant obligations created by Article 17 of the Budapest Convention. There are judicial processes short of a warrant that are already available in the Philippines to compel the production of evidence, such as a subpoena which does not require the prior establishment of probable cause as required by the Constitution, subjected as it is by a mere determination of relevance to the issue subject of the controversy [@DomingoRocoEdwardo2005]. The judicial oversight that the Supreme Court determined was necessary to ensure that individual privacy concerns are not overridden can be established through a subpoena-like process.

Notably, the Budapest Convention obligates State parties to either enact legislative \"and other measures\" to implement Article 17. It would not be necessary and would even run counter to the Philippine Constitution for a resort to legislative measures. The Constitution vests on the Supreme Court the exclusive power to \"promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts\" [@ConstitutionRepublicPhilippines1987].[^110] Only the Supreme Court may enact procedural rules, including rules governing the issuance of both warrants and subpoenas. Thus, the expeditious measures required under the Budapest Convention, should they involve judicial intervention consistent with *Disini v. Secretary of Justice*, would be within the exclusive province of the Supreme Court to undertake.

With the current judicial warrant requirement, which involves a judicial determination first of probable cause, the expediency that the Convention alludes to is often mooted. The freeing up of traffic data for purposes of allowing law enforcement to comprehensively investigate cybercrimes is deemed as a necessity.

These two concerns about the absence of a centralized data sharing framework within government and the impositions when it comes to traffic data ultimately highlight that in the Philippines, more serious and elevated discussions are still necessary to underscore the necessity and value of data as a useful tool for governance and policy administration. The intangibility of data defies common perceptions as to what is property and therefore results in a greater lack of care or concern toward this increasingly valuable public asset. A greater realization by the State of the importance and indispensable value of data would be a necessary first step for a more orderly and rational data governance framework.
